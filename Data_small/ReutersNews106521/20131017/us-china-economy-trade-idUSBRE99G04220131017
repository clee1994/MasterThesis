 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's trade will face challenges in coming months due to slowing demand from emerging markets, the commerce ministry said on Thursday. 
 Ministry spokesman Shen Danyang told a regular briefing that imports will continue to see increases in the coming months on stabilizing domestic economy. China's exports dropped 0.3 percent in September from a year earlier as sales to Southeast Asia tumbled while imports rose 7.4 percent in September from a year ago.
