 (Reuters) - U.S. orthopedic implant maker Stryker Corp ( SYK.N ) on Thursday said quarterly net profit fell 70 percent as charges for recalled products offset higher sales of its hip, knee and spine products. 
 The company reported a third-quarter net profit of $103 million, or 27 cents per share. Net sales for the quarter rose to $2.15 billion from $2.05 billion a year earlier. Excluding items such as recall and restructuring charges, Stryker earned 98 cents per share. Wall Street analysts, on average, expected 99 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the full year, the company said it still expects a profit in the range of $4.20 to $4.26 a share. (Reporting By Deena Beasley; Editing by nSteve Orlofsky)
