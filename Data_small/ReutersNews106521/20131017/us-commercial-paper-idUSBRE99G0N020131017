 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended Oct 16 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday. 
 U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $32 billion to $1.034 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - fell $21.1 billion to $996 billion. U.S. non-seasonally adjusted foreign financial commercial paper outstanding fell $14.2 billion to $220.9 billion.
