 VEVEY, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Nestle ( NESN.VX ) is sticking to its view on commodity prices for this year, its chief financial officer said on Thursday. 
 "Yes, we're maintaining our guidance on commodity prices, we're expecting a low single-digit increase," Wan Ling Martello said on the sidelines of the group's media conference after it published third-quarter results. (Reporting by Silke Koltrowitz; Writing by  Victoria Bryan )
