 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers will meet on Sunday evening to discuss a possible rescue package for Cyprus, the head of the Eurogroup said in tweet. 
 "Tomorrow 6pm #eurogroup on #cyprus," read a tweet from Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is Dutch minister of finance and president of the Eurogroup - the 17 euro-zone national finance ministers. Cyprus said on Saturday it was looking at seizing a quarter of the value of big deposits at its largest bank to meet requirements for a bailout from the European Union.
