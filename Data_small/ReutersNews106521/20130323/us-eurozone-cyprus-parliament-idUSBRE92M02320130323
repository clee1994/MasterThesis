 NICOSIA  (Reuters) - The Cypriot parliament will not debate a possible levy on bank deposits until after finance ministers of the 17-nation euro zone meet on Sunday, a senior lawmaker said on Saturday. 
 "We will meet after the Eurogroup meeting. I don't know when," the lawmaker, who declined to be named, told Reuters. (Reporting by  Michele Kambas ; Writing by Matt Robinson; Editing by Pravin Char)
