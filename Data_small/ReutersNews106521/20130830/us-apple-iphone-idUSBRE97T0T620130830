 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Apple Inc has launched a trade-in program in its U.S. retail stores for older models of its iPhone as it gears up for the launch of a new version of the smartphone, it said on Friday. 
 Apple will give customers a credit for their old phones to be used toward the purchase of a new model, an Apple spokeswoman said. A thriving industry exists for older versions of smartphones, especially the iPhone, on websites such as eBay and Gazelle. Even broken iPhones can fetch as much as $125 from vendors, who resell them in the United States and internationally. Gazelle Chief Executive Israel Ganot estimated the used smartphone and tablet market in the United States will reach $14 billion by 2015. "So there's obviously a huge opportunity here for multiple players," he said. Apple shares dipped nearly 1 percent to $487.46. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta ; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
