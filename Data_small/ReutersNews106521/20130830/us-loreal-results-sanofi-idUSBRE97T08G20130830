 PARIS  (Reuters) - L'Oreal ( OREP.PA ) Chief Executive Jean-Paul Agon reiterated on Friday that the cosmetics group could sell its stake in drugmaker Sanofi ( SASY.PA ) to help fund acquisitions. 
 "The cash is there to use," he said. "We will see if the opportunities are there to use it. We have always said that our stake in Sanofi is financial and not strategic so therefore we could use it if an opportunity presented itself." (Reporting by  Astrid Wendlandt ; Editing by  James Regan )
