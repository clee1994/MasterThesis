 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday set a tentative November 25 trial date in the U.S. government challenge to an American Airlines AAMRQA.UL merger with U.S. Airways ( LCC.N ). 
 The U.S. Justice Department had asked U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly for a March trial. The airlines had been pushing for November because holding a deal together for months puts a strain on the parties. The judge announced the date for a bench trial in open court.
