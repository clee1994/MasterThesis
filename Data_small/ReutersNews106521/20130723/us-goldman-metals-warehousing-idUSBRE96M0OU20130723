 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) has issued its first public rebuttal of mounting criticism of its metals warehousing unit, denying that Metro International Trade Services has deliberately caused aluminum shortages and inflated prices. 
 In a statement on Tuesday, the bank said Metro denied that its metals warehousing unit has moved aluminum from warehouse to warehouse in order to earn more rent. (Link to Goldman statement:  link.reuters.com/hec89t ) (Reporting by Josephine Mason; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
