 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) has hired Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) senior equity analyst Tom Ernst as a managing director to co-head its software banking team, a company spokesman said late on Wednesday. 
 Ernst will be based in San Francisco starting early July and will lead the division with Ward Waltemath, the spokesman said, confirming a Reuters report. Ernst, who has covered the software industry for 14 years, said on his LinkedIn profile that he would join the investment bank as global co-head of Software Investment banking in July. Ernst had worked at Deutsche Bank for 9 years, his LinkedIn profile showed. Ernst joins Goldman Sachs after the bank's technology group has lost a number of key bankers in recent months, including former Internet and new media chief Scott Stanford and software chief Ned Segal.
