 (Reuters) - Dell Inc's special committee and the buyout group led by the company's founder and chief executive, Michael Dell, are close to a deal, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. 
 Dell shareholders are scheduled to convene for a third time on Friday to vote on Michael Dell's $24.4 billion buyout proposal, helping decide the fate of the No. 3 PC maker after months of dueling with Carl Icahn and other unhappy investors. (Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bangalore,)
