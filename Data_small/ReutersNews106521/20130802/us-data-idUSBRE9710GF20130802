 LONDON  (Reuters) - Cross-border merger and acquisition deal volumes are down by almost a third so far this year from 2012 levels, making this the slowest year to date for international transactions since 2009, Thomson Reuters data showed on Friday. 
 Deals like the $19.3 billion merger of publishing giants Publicis Groupe ( PUBP.PA ) and Omnicom Group ( OMC.N ) have lifted announced cross-border volumes to $384 billion in 2013, according to the data, but volumes are still 31 percent lower than at the same period last year. Wall Street investment banks Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) top the advisor league table, with a little over $103 billion of cross-border work each, while JP Morgan ( JPM.N ) lies in third with $65 billion.
