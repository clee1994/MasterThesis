 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The supervisory and management boards of Kabel Deutschland have formally recommended a 7.7 billion euro ($10.2 billion) bid from Vodafone, they said in a statement on Friday. 
 "The management and supervisory boards believe the value of 87 euros per share is fair from a financial viewpoint," they said. Vodafone in June agreed to buy Germany's largest cable operator to help defend against mounting competition in its most important market. (Reporting by  Victoria Bryan )
