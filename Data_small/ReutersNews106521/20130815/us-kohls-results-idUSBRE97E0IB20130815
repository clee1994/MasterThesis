 (Reuters) - Department store chain Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ) reported a rise in quarterly comparable-store sales, boosting its shares, after downbeat sales reports from Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) and Macy's Inc ( M.N ) raised fears of a slowdown in consumer spending. 
 Shares of Kohl's, which caters to price-sensitive middle-class shoppers, rose 6 percent in early trading. The S&P 500 Department Stores Index .SPLRCRETD closed down 2.2 percent on Wednesday, after Macy's reported an unexpected decline in sales saying consumers hesitated to spend on non-essential items in a weak economy. Discount chain Wal-Mart also reported a fall in comparable store sales on Thursday. "There was a lot of relief their (Kohl's) comparable sales rose after yesterday's poor numbers from Macy's and earlier warnings from Aeropostale ( ARO.N ) and American Eagle Outfitters ( AEO.N )," Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. Teen-apparel retailers Aeropostale and American Eagle earlier this month dressed down their profit outlooks, citing weak sales and margins. Second-quarter same-store sales at Kohl's rose 0.9 percent but fell short of the average analyst estimate of a rise of 1.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Overall sales rose 2 percent to $4.29 billion, in line with analysts' estimates. The company's shares were up 5 percent at $53.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Kohl's said it expects third-quarter earnings in the range of 83 cents to 92 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 94 cents per share. Kohl's said net income fell 4 percent to $231 million in the quarter ended August 3, from $240 million a year earlier. However, profit rose to $1.04 from $1.00 on a per-share basis, as the average number of shares outstanding decreased.
