 (Reuters) - Security services provider ADT Corp ( ADT.N ) said it may have to contribute to a tax bill faced by former parent Tyco International Ltd ( TYC.N ) if the total amount assessed by the IRS exceeds $1.85 billion. 
 Tyco said on Monday it received a notice from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service stating that several of the company's former units, including ADT, owed taxes of $883.3 million and penalties of $154.0 million for tax years from 1997 to 2000. ( r.reuters.com/nyr39t ) Tyco also said the IRS had disallowed interest and related deductions recognized on the U.S. income tax returns totaling about $2.86 billion related to intercompany debt transactions. The company said four former subsidiaries would share the liabilities under tax-sharing agreements. The companies are Covidien Plc ( COV.N ), TE Connectivity Ltd ( TEL.N ), ADT and Pentair Ltd ( PNR.N ). ( link.reuters.com/saw39t ) Shares of ADT, which was spun off from Tyco in September, were little changed at $40.46 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
