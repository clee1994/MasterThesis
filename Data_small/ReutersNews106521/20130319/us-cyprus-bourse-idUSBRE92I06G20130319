 (Reuters) - Cyprus's Stock Exchange said it would suspend trade on Tuesday and Wednesday while banks on the island remained shut pending the imposition of a levy on deposits in return for an international bailout. 
 The decision was taken to ensure the smooth functioning of the exchange and to protect investors, the Stock Exchange said in a statement. (Reporting By  Michele Kambas ; Editing by Alison Birrane)
