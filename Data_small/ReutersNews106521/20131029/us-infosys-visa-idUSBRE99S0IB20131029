 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Indian IT firm Infosys Ltd ( INFY.NS ) said on Tuesday it was in the process of reaching a settlement with the U.S. government over the company's alleged misuse of temporary business visas. 
 U.S. authorities have been investigating India's second-largest information technology services exporter since 2011. The Wall Street Journal had earlier said that the United States was expected to announce a resolution in the case on Wednesday. In a statement, Infosys said a resolution had yet to be finalized. "In response to reports attributed to Justice Department officials, Infosys is in the process of completing a civil resolution with the government regarding its investigation of visa issues and I-9 documentation errors," the company said. "The resolution has not been finalized," it added. Indian IT outsourcing firms like Infosys use thousands of visas to bring in employees, mainly from India, a practice that has come under intense scrutiny as it is seen by some U.S. policymakers as hurting the American job market. Earlier this month, Infosys said it had set aside a reserve of $35 million as it worked towards a resolution for the U.S. government's investigation.
