 PARIS  (Reuters) - Airbus ( EAD.PA ) said on Monday it would carry out a review of the way Honeywell ( HON.N ) emergency locator beacons are integrated into its aircraft following a preliminary report on a fire on a parked Boeing jet this month. 
 The European planemaker stopped short of asking airlines to inspect the devices across its fleet as Boeing ( BA.N ) did late on Sunday, saying it had never had a problem with the units which are at the center of a probe into the Heathrow fire. "Our records do not show any incidents of this nature," an Airbus spokesman said. "However, as a precautionary measure, we will do an additional review of the integration of the device in order to determine whether there is a need to apply any lessons from the AAIB findings," the spokesman added, referring to Britain's air accident investigation authority.
