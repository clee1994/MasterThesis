 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Belarussian investigators said on Monday that they intend to seize property and assets of Russia's Uralkali ( URKA.MM ), the world's top potash producer, following the collapse of a joint Russian-Belarussian venture, RIA reported. 
 Belarus detained the head of Russia's Uralkali, drawing a fierce rebuke from Moscow, and investigators said that Uralkali had incurred $100 million in damages to Belarussian interests. "Evaluating the documents received by investigators, a decision will be reached to seize the property and assets of Uralkali," RIA reported the investigators as saying.
