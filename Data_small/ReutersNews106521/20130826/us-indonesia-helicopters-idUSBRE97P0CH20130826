 JAKARTA  (Reuters) - The United States will sell the Indonesian army eight Apache attack helicopters in a deal worth $500 million including radar, training and maintenance, a U.S. defense official said on Monday. 
 "We are working on further details of the delivery and training time line now," the official said on condition of anonymity. The sale of Boeing's ( BA.N ) AH-64E Apache helicopters was announced during a visit by U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to Jakarta, his second stop on a week-long four-nation trip to Southeast Asia that began in Malaysia on Saturday. "Providing Indonesia these world-class helicopters is an example of our commitment to help build Indonesia's military capability," Hagel told reporters.
