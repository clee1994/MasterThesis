 (Reuters) - Investigators searching for the cause of a fire on a Boeing Co ( BA.N ) Dreamliner in London last week are looking at the battery in an emergency locator transmitter built by Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ), a source familiar with the probe told Reuters on Monday. 
 That device is powered by a lithium manganese battery, a long-life battery that has been around for decades and used widely in the military as well as products like digital cameras, walkie-talkies and pacemakers. The following are some facts about these batteries: - Lithium manganese dioxide batteries (LiMnO2) are disposable, or "primary" batteries, that have a shelf life of 10 years or more. They offer double the voltage and last at least two times longer than cheaper alkaline counterparts. - They should not be confused with lithium-ion batteries, a powerful family of rechargeable batteries. These devices are used widely in smart phones, electric cars and in other parts of the Dreamliner. In its Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, General Motors Co ( GM.N ) uses a lithium-ion battery with a manganese chemistry. - Lithium manganese battery cells come in a number of shapes, including the cylindrical form often used in consumer products. - About half of each cell is made up of manganese dioxide while lithium accounts for 3 to 4 percent, according to a fact sheet from Saft Groupe ( S1A.PA ) dated November 2012. - Other makers of lithium manganese batteries include Ultralife ( ULBI.O ), identified by a source as the supplier to Honeywell, Sony ( 6758.T ), Panasonic ( 6752.T ) and Eagle Picher ( EGLP.PK ).
