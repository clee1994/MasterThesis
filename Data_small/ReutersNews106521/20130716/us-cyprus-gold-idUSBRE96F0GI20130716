 NICOSIA  (Reuters) - Cyprus said on Tuesday a sale of its gold reserves was not the only option under consideration to pay down its debt and that other alternatives were being considered. 
 "The possibility of selling gold is known, but only as an option," Finance Minister Harris Georgiades told reporters. "It will be considered, when the time comes, with options, or rather, all other options." (Reporting by  Michele Kambas ; editing by  Jason Neely )
