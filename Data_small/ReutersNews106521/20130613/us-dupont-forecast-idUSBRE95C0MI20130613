 (Reuters) - Chemical maker DuPont ( DD.N ) said its operating profit would fall more than it expected in the first half of the year as a wet spring in North America and Europe hurt its agriculture business, sending its shares down 1.5 percent. 
 Dupont is focusing on food and agricultural products to cut its dependence on a weakening market for paint pigments. The company expects its first-half operating earnings per share to be about 10 percent below last year, Chief Financial Officer Nicholas Fanandakis said in a statement on Thursday. The company had forecast a 7 to 9 percent fall in April. "Unseasonably cool, wet weather across North America and Europe is impacting our agriculture and nutrition and health segments' second-quarter revenues and costs," Fanandakis said. The company also expects full-year operating earnings to be at the low end of its forecast of $3.85 to $4.05 per share. DuPont's agricultural business accounted for 45 percent of its first-quarter revenue of $10.4 billion. The company will report second-quarter results on July 23. The stock was trading at $53.43 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday morning. (Reporting by Swetha Gopinath in Bangalore; Editing by Don Sebastian)
