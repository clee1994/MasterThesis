 (Reuters) - Marathon Oil Corp ( MRO.N ) said on Thursday that Chairman and Chief Executive Clarence Cazalot will retire December 31 and be replaced by a senior Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) executive. 
 Lee Tillman, 51, currently vice president of engineering for Exxon Mobil's development unit, will become Marathon Oil's CEO in 2014, the company said in a statement. Dennis Reilley, Marathon Oil's current lead director, will be nominated to become non-executive chairman once Cazalot retires, the company said. (Reporting by  Ernest Scheyder ; Editing by Gerald E.
