 (Reuters) - Japanese machinery maker Toyota Industries Corp ( 6201.T ) plans to invest about 300 billion yen ($3.18 billion) over the next three years as it looks to make itself more competitive, the Nikkei said. 
 The company will make the investments through fiscal 2015, its new President Akira Onishi told the Japanese daily. Toyota Industries will expand its overseas output of car air-conditioner parts and other products, as well acquire businesses, the Nikkei reported.
