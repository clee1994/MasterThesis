 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Ultralife Corp ( ULBI.O ) makes the lithium-manganese battery that powers the emergency transmitter that is being investigated as a possible cause of last week's fire on a Boeing 787 in London, a source familiar with the investigation said on Monday. 
 As reported earlier, the emergency locator transmitter, or ELT, is made by Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ). Ultralife, based in Newark, New York, was not immediately available for comment. Honeywell says it has produced over 3,000 of the emergency beacons, equipped with the lithium-manganese batteries, since 2005, and there have been no safety incidents.
