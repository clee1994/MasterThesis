 MILAN  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) is interested in buying assets that Italian insurer Unipol ( UNPI.MI ) must sell as part of a merger with peer Fondiaria-SAI ( FOSA.MI ), business daily Il Sole 24 Ore said on Saturday. 
 The paper said Berkshire was eying commercial assets belonging to Milano Assicurazioni ( ADMI.MI ), a unit controlled by Fondiaria. Unipol has been forced by Italy's anti-trust authority to sell portfolio assets with premiums totaling around 1.7 billion euros ($2.2 billion) as part of its rescue of the Fondiaria-SAI group. The merger, which will create Italy's No. 2 insurer, is expected to close by the end of the year. Unipol CEO Carlo Cimbri said in May there had been 10-15 expressions of interest for the assets, including from Allianz ( ALVG.DE ), Axa ( AXAF.PA ), Aviva ( AV.L ) and Zurich ( ZURN.VX ). Insurance accounted for roughly a quarter of Berkshire's revenues in 2012. Buffett's investments are viewed by many investors as a seal of approval from one of the world's most respected businessmen. Non-binding offers for the Unipol assets are expected next Friday, Il Sole said. Neither Unipol nor Berkshire Hathaway Inc were immediately available for a comment.
