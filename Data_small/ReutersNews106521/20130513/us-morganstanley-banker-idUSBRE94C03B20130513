 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley's ( MS.N ) deputy head of investment banking, Ji-Yeun Lee, has left the firm in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the company. 
 Lee was a key lieutenant to Paul Taubman, who previously co-headed the company's investment bank. Taubman stepped down late last year and his long-time rival Colm Kelleher took full control of the unit. Lee declined to comment to the Journal on her future plans.

Morgan Stanley could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside of regular U.S. business hours. (Reporting by  Sakthi Prasad  in Bangalore; Editing by  Edwina Gibbs )
