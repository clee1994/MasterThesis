 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Shares in South Korean battery maker Samsung SDI ( 006400.KS ) fell as much as 3.7 percent on Friday, after a video of a burning Tesla electric car sent the U.S. firm's shares plunging overnight. 
 U.S. emergency officials said the fire occurred in the electric vehicle's lithium-ion battery, the latest in a string of problems for the batteries, which are used heavily in electric vehicles sold by various automakers. Japan's Panasonic Corp ( 6752.T ) currently supplies the batteries used in the Model S, but analysts expect Samsung SDI to supply batteries to Tesla's upcoming models.
