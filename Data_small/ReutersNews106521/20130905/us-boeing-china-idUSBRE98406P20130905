 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China will need 5,580 commercial aircraft worth some $780 billion over the next 20 years, according to a statement released by Boeing Co ( BA.N ) on Thursday. 
 Tourism in China and within Asia travel will drive the need for single-aisle airplanes, Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, is quoted as saying in the statement, released at a company event in Beijing. Deliveries in that segment will total 3,900 by 2032, Boeing said. (Reporting by Fang Yan and Matt Miller)
