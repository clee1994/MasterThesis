 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ) has reached a tentative wage deal with its South Korean labor union, a union spokesman said on Thursday. 
 Should the union approve the deal in a vote on Monday, Hyundai, the world's fifth-biggest carmaker along with affiliate Kia Motors ( 000270.KS ), should avoid further production losses. It had suffered a series of partial strikes. (Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by  Michael Urquhart )
