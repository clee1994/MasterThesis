 PARIS  (Reuters) - Boeing ( BA.N ) said it had asked airlines using Honeywell ( HON.N ) fixed emergency beacons to inspect the devices on most of its worldwide fleet to gather data for regulators following a recent fire on board a parked 787 Dreamliner. 
 Britain's accident investigation board has recommended worldwide inspections of lithium battery-powered emergency locator transmitters in the wake of the fire on an Ethiopian Airlines-owned Dreamliner in London earlier this month. "Boeing is asking specific operators of 717, Next-Generation 737, 747-400, 767 and 777s to inspect aircraft with the Honeywell fixed emergency locator transmitters," a Boeing spokesman said in an emailed statement on Sunday. "The purpose of these inspections is to gather data to support potential rulemaking by regulators," he added. (Reporting by  Tim Hepher ; Editing by  Paul Tait )
