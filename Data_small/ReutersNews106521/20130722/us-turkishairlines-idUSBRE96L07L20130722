 ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - Flag carrier Turkish Airlines ( THYAO.IS ) said on Monday it had decided to convert an option to buy five Boeing B777-300ER airplanes into a firm order. 
 The aircraft are slated for the delivery in 2016 and 2017, the state-run airline said in a filing with the Istanbul stock exchange. Turkish Airlines said in April it planned to buy a total 95 plans from U.S.-based Boeing ( BA.N ) by 2021, including 25 options. (Reporting by  Ayla Jean Yackley )
