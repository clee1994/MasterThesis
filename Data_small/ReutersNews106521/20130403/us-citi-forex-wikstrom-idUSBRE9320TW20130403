 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup ( C.N ) appointed Roland Wikstrom as the head of U.S. G10 rates trading after the previous head Nicolas Brophy left the bank, a Citigroup spokesman said on Wednesday. 
 When asked, the spokesman declined to offer a reason for Brophy's departure. Wikstrom's group trades the government debt and interest rates products of the Group of 10 industrialized countries. (Reporting by  Richard Leong ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
