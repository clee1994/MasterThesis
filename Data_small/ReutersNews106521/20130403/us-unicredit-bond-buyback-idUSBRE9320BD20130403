 MILAN  (Reuters) - Unicredit ( CRDI.MI ), Italy's biggest bank by assets, said on Wednesday it will buy back senior bonds for up to 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion). 
 The bank aims to reduce debt that will come due in the 2015-2017 period and to better use its liquidity. The offer to purchase the bonds will start on April 8 and end on April 24, the lender said, adding it could, however, end the offer early, extend it or even reopen it.
