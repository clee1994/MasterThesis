 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ) said on Tuesday its China sales jumped 26 percent to 86,729 vehicles in April from a year earlier, maintaining its momentum in the world's biggest car market. 
 The results come as Japanese rivals such as Toyota Motor ( 7203.T ) attempt to recover from sluggish sales in China last month. (Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by  Daniel Magnowski )
