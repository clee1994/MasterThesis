 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher on Monday said any tapering in the U.S. central bank's bond-buying stimulus program will depend on the strength of economic data. 
 Speaking at a conference of business economists in Sydney, Fisher also said U.S. corporate balance sheets are stronger than ever. Fisher has long been concerned by the Fed's "hyper-accommodative" monetary policy, in part due to the danger of market disruptions when it comes time to slim down its massive balance sheet. Fisher is not a voting member this year, but will be in 2014. (Reporting by  Wayne Cole ; Editing by  John Mair )
