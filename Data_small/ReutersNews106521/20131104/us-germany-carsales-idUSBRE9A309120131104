 HAMBURG  (Reuters) - Car sales in Germany, Europe's largest auto market, stabilized in October in a sign of a recovery in vehicle demand in the region. 
 New auto registrations in Germany, home to Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ), Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) and BMW ( BMWG.DE ), rose 2 percent year-on-year, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity because official figures have not been published yet. Year-to-date, German deliveries have dropped between 5 and 6 percent, the source further said. Registrations can be an imperfect indicator for the health of Germany's car market, since they can lag demand by around two to three months.
