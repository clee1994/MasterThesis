 PARIS  (Reuters) - Airbus ( EAD.PA ) is offering airlines a shorter-range "regional" version of its A350-900 passenger jet, sales chief John Leahy told Reuters at the Paris Airshow on Thursday. 
 The previously undisclosed move emerged two days after Boeing ( BA.N ) launched a larger version of its 787 Dreamliner, designed for airlines willing to surrender part of the range of its newest jets to carry more people on dense, intra-Asian routes. The "regional" version of Europe's newest passenger jet does not involve design changes to the A350, which first flew last week, but it will be offered with lower-thrust Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) engines tuned for shorter routes than the baseline model. "I have a regional version...On the A350-900 there is a regional version with de-rated thrust," Leahy told Reuters. An Airbus spokeswoman said the regional A350 would "match the payload-range capability of the (Boeing) 787-10". (Reporting by  Tim Hepher , Editing by James Regan)
