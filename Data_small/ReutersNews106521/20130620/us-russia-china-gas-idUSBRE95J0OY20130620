 ST PETERSBURG, Russia  (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he has high hopes for cooperation between "Chinese friends" and Russian gas companies Novatek ( NVTK.MM ) and Gazprom ( GAZP.MM ). 
 Last week, a source told Reuters that China's Sinopec was negotiating to join a $20 billion liquefied natural gas project run by Novatek. Gazprom hopes to clinch a deal by the year-end to supply China with pipeline gas starting from 2018. (Reporting by Alexei Anishchuk; writing by Vladimir Soldatkin; editing by Steve Gutterman)
