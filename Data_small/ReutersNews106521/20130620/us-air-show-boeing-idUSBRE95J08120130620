 PARIS  (Reuters) - Boeing ( BA.N ) launched the 787-10 version of its flagship Dreamliner aircraft at the Paris Airshow on Tuesday with 102 provisional orders worth nearly $30 billion at list prices. 
 The news came after rival Airbus ( EAD.PA ) clinched an $11.5 billion order from UK budget airline easyJet ( EZJ.L ) for 135 A320neos, including 35 current-generation planes and 100 next-generation versions, with options for a further 100 aircraft. Boeing's much-anticipated launch with five airlines and leasing companies marked a sign of support for the 787 just months after the first version was grounded due to battery problems. The buyers are Air Lease ( AL.N ) with 30 planes, GE Capital Services ( GE.N ) with 10, British Airways ( ICAG.L ) with 12, Singapore Airlines ( SIAL.SI ) with 30 and United Airlines with 20. United's order includes 10 new planes and 10 conversions from the earlier 787-9 model, due for first flight later this year. The third variant of the Dreamliner family will have a range of 7,000 nautical miles, with seating for up to 330 passengers. United said it expected to receive its first 787-10 in 2018. The plane will be 25 percent more efficient to operate than current comparable planes, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Ray Conner said. The 787-8, introduced in late 2011, was grounded worldwide in January after its lithium-ion batteries overheated on two jets in about a week. It resumed commercial service in May after Boeing installed a redesigned battery system on the 50 jets in service.
