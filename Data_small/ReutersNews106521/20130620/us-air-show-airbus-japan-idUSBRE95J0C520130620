 PARIS  (Reuters) - Airbus' ( EAD.PA ) sales chief expects to win orders from a major Japanese airline at some point in the future, he told the Paris Airshow on Thursday. 
 "It is just a matter of time before Japan Airlines ( 9201.T ) or All Nippon Airways ( 9202.T ) fly Airbus wide-body aircraft," John Leahy told a news conference at the show. (Reporting by  Maria Sheahan ; Editing by  James Regan )
