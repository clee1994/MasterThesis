Following are some recent cases. Churchill Mining ( CHLL.L ) Churchill is suing the Indonesian government for $1.05 billion plus interest for revoking its licenses over the East Kutai coal site, estimated to contain 2.8 billion metric tons (3.08 billion tons) of coal reserves. Licenses to the area are now owned by the Nusantara Group, which is controlled by a politician, Prabowo Subianto. Newmont Mining ( NEM.N ) The provincial government of West Nusa Tenggara is contesting the central government's 2011 agreement to buy a 7 percent stake that Newmont was required to divest in the huge Batu Hijau copper and gold mine. Avocet Mining ( AVM.L ) Avocet Mining is facing a $1.95 billion lawsuit by former partner PT Lebong Tandai over the sale of its Indonesian and Malaysian gold mines in 2011. Lebong Tandai claims Avocet had agreed to sell the assets to it.
