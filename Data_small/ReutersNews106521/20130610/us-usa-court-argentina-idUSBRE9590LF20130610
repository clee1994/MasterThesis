 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear British company BG Group Plc's ( BG.L ) appeal over a $185.3 million arbitration award it won against Argentina that an appeals court later threw out. 
 A U.S. district court ruled in 2007 that BG, a natural gas exploration and distribution company, should recover because a decision by the Argentine government in 2002 to introduce a gas price freeze breached a 1993 treaty between Britain and Argentina.
