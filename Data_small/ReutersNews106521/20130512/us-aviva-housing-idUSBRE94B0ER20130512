 (Reuters) - British insurer Aviva Plc ( AV.L ) could buy thousands of homes in London and the southeast of England to use as rented properties in a deal with social housing provider A2Dominion, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the situation. 
 The two companies, which are in advanced negotiations, plan to launch a special purpose vehicle that would build a mix of social and open market rented houses, the FT said on its website. Insurers and pension funds are poised to spend 7 billion pounds ($11 billion) on rental homes in Britain in a bet that a shortage of housing and mortgages produces a generation of renters rather than owners. Larger rival Prudential Plc's ( PRU.L ) said last month it would buy more than 500 private rental units from Berkeley Group ( BKGH.L ) for 105.4 million pounds. A2Dominion is one of Britain's largest social housing providers, owning 34,000 houses in and around London, according to the FT. (Reporting by Abhirup Roy in Bangalore; Editing by Marguerita Choy)
