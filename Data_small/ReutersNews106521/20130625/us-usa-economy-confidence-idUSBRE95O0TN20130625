 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer confidence jumped in June to its highest level in over five years as Americans were more optimistic about business and labor market conditions, according to a private sector report released on Tuesday. 
 The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes rose to 81.4 from a downwardly revised 74.3 the month before. It was the highest since January 2008 and beat expectations for 75.4. May was originally reported as 76.2. (Reporting by  Leah Schnurr ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
