 (Reuters) - American Airlines on Wednesday said it plans to add nonstop flights to Hong Kong and Shanghai from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport next year. 
 AMR Corp's ( AAMRQ.PK ) American, which hopes to exit bankruptcy protection by merging with US Airways Group ( LCC.N ) and forming the world's biggest carrier, said it would operate Boeing ( BA.N ) 777 planes on the flights to the Asian cities. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in August challenging the proposed merger with US Airways, saying it would lead to higher prices. A federal trial in the case is set to begin on November 25.
