 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP ( KMP.N ), the largest U.S. pipeline company, said on Wednesday its profit in the third quarter rose sharply and distributions rose 7 percent, helped by acquisitions. 
 Kinder Morgan's quarterly distribution rose to $1.35 per unit, slightly above Wall Street expectations for $1.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company's year-ago distribution was $1.26. The Houston-based master limited partnership reported net income of $697 million, up from $383 million a year earlier. The company's distributable cash flow rose 22 percent from a year earlier to $544 million. MLPs, a structure favored by energy companies, pay no taxes because they pay out nearly all profits in distributions to investors. Kinder Morgan left its outlook for its full-year distribution per common unit unchanged at $5.33. Kinder Morgan Inc ( KMI.N ), the MLP's general partner, acquired Copano Energy LLC in May of this year and also bought the pipeline and gathering assets of El Paso Corp in May 2012.
