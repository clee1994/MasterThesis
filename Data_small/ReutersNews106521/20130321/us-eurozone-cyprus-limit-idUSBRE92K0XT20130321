 NICOSIA  (Reuters) - Stricken Cyprus Popular Bank imposed a 260 euro per day limit on ATM withdrawals on Thursday to cope with high demand, the island's second largest lender said in a statement. 
 Customers queued to withdraw funds on Thursday on widespread rumors that the bank was to be closed down, later denied by the central bank. (Reporting by  Michele Kambas ; Writing by Matt Robinson)
