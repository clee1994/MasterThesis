 NICOSIA  (Reuters) - Lawmakers in Cyprus postponed until Friday a debate on emergency legislation tabled by the government to confront the island's financial crisis, saying they needed more time for consultations. 
 The government had submitted bills proposing the creation of a "Solidarity Fund" of state assets, the imposition of capital controls on banks and measures to address the island's stricken banks as it scrambles to clinch a bailout from the European Union.
