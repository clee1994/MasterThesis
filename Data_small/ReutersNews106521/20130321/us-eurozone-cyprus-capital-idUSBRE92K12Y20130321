 NICOSIA  (Reuters) - The Cypriot government submitted a bill to parliament on Thursday giving the finance minister or central bank governor the right to impose capital controls on banks. 
 "The purpose of this law is, in case of an emergency for purposes of public order or security, to assign powers to the (Finance) Minister, or the (Central Bank) governor to take and impose temporary restrictive measures, including restrictions on capital controls," said the bill, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. Parliament was due to sit on Thursday evening. (Reporting by  Michele Kambas ; Writing by Matt Robinson; editing by Ron Askew)
