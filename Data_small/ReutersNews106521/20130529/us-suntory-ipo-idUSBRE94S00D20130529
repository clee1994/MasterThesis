 (Reuters) - Suntory Holdings Ltd is set to receive Tokyo Stock Exchange approval as soon as Wednesday to list its food and non-alcoholic beverage unit, a source with direct knowledge of the process told Reuters. 
 The clearance would set the stage for an initial public offering that a separate source with knowledge of the situation has said could raise as much as 500 billion yen ($5 billion), in what is expected to be Japan's largest IPO of the year. The Osaka-based drinks maker wants to raise funds for acquisitions and growth in overseas markets. Japanese beverage companies such as Suntory, Kirin Holdings Co Ltd ( 2503.T ) and Asahi Group Holdings Ltd ( 2502.T ) are aggressively pursuing overseas expansion to lessen their reliance on a shrinking home market. Suntory, which makes C.C. Lemon brand soft drinks and Yamazaki single malt whisky, has set a goal of more than doubling sales at its food and beverage unit to 2 trillion yen by 2020. Suntory has acquired soft drinks maker Orangina Schweppes and New Zealand's No. 2 beverage firm Funcor Group. In 2011, it entered into a joint venture with Indonesian food and beverage group GarudaFood. (Editing by  Kevin Krolicki  and Edmund Klamann)
