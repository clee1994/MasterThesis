 NICOSIA  (Reuters) - Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades, due in Brussels on Sunday to seek an 11th-hour reprieve from financial meltdown, has a very difficult task ahead of him if he is to save the island's economy, a government spokesman said. 
 Anastasiades and his team, who are seeking a bailout from international lenders, have a "very difficult task to accomplish to save the Cypriot economy and avert a disorderly default if there is no final agreement on a loan accord," the spokesman said.
