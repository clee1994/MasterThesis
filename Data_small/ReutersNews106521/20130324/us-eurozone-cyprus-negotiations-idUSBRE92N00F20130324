 NICOSIA  (Reuters) - Negotiations on an EU/IMF bailout for Cyprus are "at a very delicate stage" and will continue in Brussels on Sunday, the Cypriot government said, describing the situation as "very difficult". 
 In a statement, the government said President Nicos Anastasiades would travel to Brussels early on Sunday morning, with a Monday deadline looming to seal the bailout or see the island's stricken banks cut off from emergency funding. (Reporting by  Michele Kambas ; Writing by Matt Robinson)
