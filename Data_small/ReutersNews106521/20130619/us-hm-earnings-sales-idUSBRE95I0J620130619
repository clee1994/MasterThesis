 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - H&M ( HMb.ST ), the world's second-largest fashion retailer, reported a sharp rise in sales so far in June, with new collections selling well. 
 Chief Executive Karl-Johan Persson said that although H&M had entered the third quarter with higher inventories than planned, June promotions had not started earlier than last year and appetite for marked-down clothes was good but more notably, new collections were selling better than expected. "What's great to see is that it's primarily full-price, the new collections, that sells well," he told Reuters on Wednesday. "That's where we over-achieve. There may of course be pent-up demand from a cold spring, who knows. But it feels good." (Reporting by Anna Ringstrom; Editing by  David Holmes )
