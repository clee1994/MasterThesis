 PARIS  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) has signed a contract with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd ( 7011.T ) to begin work on a final assembly and check-out plant for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in Japan, it said on Wednesday. 
 Steve O'Bryan, Lockheed vice president on the F-35 program, announced the contract agreement at the Paris Airshow. He declined to give details on the value of the contract. A similar facility built in Italy to assemble F-35 jets in Europe cost an estimated 800 million Euros ($1.1 billion). (Reporting By  Andrea Shalal-Esa ; Editing by Greg Mahlich)
