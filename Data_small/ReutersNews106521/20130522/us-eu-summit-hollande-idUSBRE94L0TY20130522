 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - French President Francois Hollande said on Wednesday that European countries would start working in June on an automatic exchange of tax information, in a bid to recoup some of the billions of euros lost in tax evasion each year. 
 Hollande told a news conference following a four-hour summit of European leaders that the bloc also intended to clamp down on international companies who use legal loopholes to avoid taxes. "We cannot accept that a certain number of companies can put themselves in situations where they escape paying taxes in ways that are legal today. We must coordinate at a European level, harmonize our rules and come up with strategies to stop this," he said. (Reporting by Julien Ponthus; Writing by  Catherine Bremer ; Editing by  Leigh Thomas )
