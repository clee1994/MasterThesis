 (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney said on Wednesday that customer interest in the 777X wide-body airplane is "high and still growing," and that he expects to formally launch the aircraft program later this year. 
 The company began offering the next-generation plane to customers May 2. Speaking at an investor conference, McNerney also said the 787-9X, a stretch version of the 787 Dreamliner, remains on track for first flight this year. (Reporting by  Alwyn Scott ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
