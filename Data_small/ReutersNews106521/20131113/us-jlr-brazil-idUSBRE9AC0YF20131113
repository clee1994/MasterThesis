 LONDON  (Reuters) - British luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover on Wednesday said it was studying the possibility of opening a manufacturing plant in Brazil. 
 "A detailed feasibility study is underway to consider Brazil as a possible future location for a Jaguar Land Rover automotive facility," the company said in a statement sent to Reuters on Wednesday, adding that "no final decisions have been made." The company, owned by India's Tata Motors ( TAMO.NS ), added that it has ambitious plans to expand its manufacturing footprint and increase production in markets outside of Britain, particularly in China and Brazil. Earlier on Wednesday Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo reported that Land Rover was looking to invest around 270 million pounds ($431.72 million) in a facility to build SUVs in Rio de Janeiro state.
