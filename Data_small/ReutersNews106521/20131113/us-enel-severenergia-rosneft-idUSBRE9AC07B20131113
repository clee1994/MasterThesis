 MILAN  (Reuters) - Italy's biggest utility Enel ( ENEI.MI ) said on Wednesday it had completed the sale of its stake in SeverEnergia to Russia's Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ) for $1.8 billion. 
 The deal had been announced on September 24. In October the co-owner of Russia's Novatek ( NVTK.MM ) said he still hoped to buy a stake in SeverEnergia. (Reporting by  Stephen Jewkes ; editing by Francesca Landini)
