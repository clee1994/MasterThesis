 MILAN  (Reuters) - Italian airline Alitalia CAITLA.UL said on Wednesday it had extended a Friday deadline for shareholders to subscribe to a 300 million euro ($402 million) capital increase to November 27, giving top shareholder Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) more time to sign up. 
 The company also said that as part of a revised business plan it would cut the number of its medium-range aircraft, but maintain the number of hours flown through a better use of its fleet. It will also increase the number of its international and intercontinental flights, it said in a statement, as it seeks to boost revenues by focusing on the more lucrative long-haul market.
