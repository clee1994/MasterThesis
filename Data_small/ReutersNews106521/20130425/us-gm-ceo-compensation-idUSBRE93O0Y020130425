 (Reuters) - General Motors Co ( GM.N ) paid Chief Executive Dan Akerson $11.1 million in 2012, a 44 percent increase from 2011 due to $2 million in restricted stock units that Akerson received in 2011 but vested in 2012. 
 Akerson's salary remained at $1.7 million. His stock awards totaled $7.3 million, excluding the $2 million he was awarded in 2011, GM said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. ( link.reuters.com/dap67t ) His pay package was $7.7 million in 2011. The largest U.S. automaker has set a $9 million target for Akerson's compensation due to restrictions set by the U.S. government. GM executives are governed by a special paymaster from the government as part of provisions put in place after the company's U.S.-funded bankruptcy restructuring in 2009. Media reports said in February that GM wanted to pay its top executive $11.1 million for 2013, which the company had denied. Akerson's salary lags that of Ford Motor Co's ( F.N ) CEO, Alan Mulally, who was paid $21 million, including stock awards, options and other perks in 2012. (Reporting by  A.
