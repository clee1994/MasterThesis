 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) reported lower quarterly earnings on Thursday as oil and natural gas production edged down along with crude prices. 
 Conoco had a first-quarter profit of $2.1 billion, or $1.73 per share, down from $2.9 billion, or $2.27 per share, a year earlier. Oil and gas output from continuing operations was 1.56 million barrels oil equivalent (boe) per day, down slightly from 1.58 million boe per day a year earlier.
