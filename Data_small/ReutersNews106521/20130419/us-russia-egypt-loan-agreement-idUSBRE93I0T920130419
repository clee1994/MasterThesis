 SOCHI, Russia  (Reuters) - Egypt's trade and industry minister, Hatem Saleh, said on Friday that no agreement has been reached on a Russian loan to Egypt. 
 Speaking after a meeting between Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Saleh said "today we have reached no conclusion on that loan." A Moscow-based source said previously that Egypt planned to discuss a possible $2 billion loan.
