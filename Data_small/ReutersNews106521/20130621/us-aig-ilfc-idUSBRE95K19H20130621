 (Reuters) - American International Group's ( AIG.N ) unit extended the date for a Chinese consortium to get regulatory approvals to buy the airplane-leasing business till July 31. 
 AIG announced the deal to sell International Lease Finance Corp (ILFC) last December for $4.8 billion to a consortium including New China Trust, one-fifth owned by Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ), China Aviation Industrial Fund and P3 Investments Ltd. Last month, the two sides agreed to extend the deadline for the deal's closing by a month, to mid-June. AIG may terminate the deal if it does not close by July 31, ILFC said in an amendment to its initial public offering on Friday.
