 (Reuters) - The decline in U.S. sales of carbonated soft drinks accelerated last year as more consumers reached for alternatives, according to a leading beverage industry newsletter. 
 Total sales volume fell 1.2 percent in 2012 to 9.17 billion cases, according to Beverage Digest. That compares with declines of 1 percent in 2011 and 0.5 percent in 2010. Excluding fast-growing energy drinks such as Red Bull and Monster Beverage Corp ( MNST.O ) products, soda volume would have fallen 1.7 percent, the newsletter said. By company, Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc ( DPS.N ) each gained 0.1 percentage point of market share, while PepsiCo Inc's ( PEP.N ) share slipped by 0.4 percentage points.
