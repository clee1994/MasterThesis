 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) Co-Chief Executive Juergen Fitschen said it was unclear when a decade-long dispute with representatives of deceased media magnate Leo Kirch would come to an end. 
 "An end of the proceedings is not in sight," Fitschen told an extraordinary shareholder meeting in Frankfurt. "There are currently no negotiations to reach a settlement." (Reporting By Edward Taylor)
