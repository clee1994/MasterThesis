 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said on Thursday he was confident that Boeing's ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliner would be cleared to fly and carry passengers again soon, but he couldn't predict when that would be. 
 The airline suffered a serious impact and will seek compensation from Boeing for the Dreamliner being grounded worldwide after batteries overheated on two jets in January, Al Baker said at a press conference. (Reporting by  Nivedita Bhattacharjee  in Chicago; Writing by  Alwyn Scott )
