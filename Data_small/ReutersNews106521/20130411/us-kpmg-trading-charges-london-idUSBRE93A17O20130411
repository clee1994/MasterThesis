 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Scott London, the former senior auditor at KPMG in Los Angeles who was charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud, intends to plead guilty at his May 17 arraignment, his lawyer said on Thursday. 
 London, accused by U.S. authorities of passing non-public corporate information on five of KPMG's clients to a friend, remains free on a $150,000 bond but was ordered to surrender his passport, lawyer Harland Braun told reporters. (Reporting By Dana Feldman; Editing by  Gary Hill )
