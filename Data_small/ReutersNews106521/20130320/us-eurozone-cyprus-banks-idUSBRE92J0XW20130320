 NICOSIA  (Reuters) - Banks in Cyprus will remain closed on Thursday and Friday, a government official said, as the euro zone country tries to avoid a financial meltdown having rejected the terms of a European Union bailout. 
 With Monday a public holiday, the move effectively closes lenders until Tuesday, March 26. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. (Writing by Matt Robinson; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
