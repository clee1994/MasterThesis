 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Cypriot banks' units in Greece will remain shut on Thursday and Friday in line with an extended bank holiday in the island nation, Greece's finance ministry said on Wednesday. 
 That means the local bank branches of the three Cypriot banks with operations in the country will not reopen until Tuesday, since Monday is a bank holiday in Greece. (Reporting by Angeliki Koutantou, editing by Deepa Babington)
