 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve voted unanimously on Thursday to propose a tough new plan requiring banks to hold assets they could easily sell in a credit crunch. 
 The plan, which is stricter than the liquidity requirements agreed upon by international regulators, is aimed at making banks safer after the 2007-09 credit crisis. The industry will have 90 days to comment on the proposal, after which it will be finalized. (Reporting by  Douwe Miedema  and  Emily Stephenson ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
