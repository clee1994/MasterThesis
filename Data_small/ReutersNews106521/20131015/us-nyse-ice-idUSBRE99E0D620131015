 (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext NYX.N said Chief Financial Officer Michael Geltzeiler and General Counsel John Halvey will leave the company shortly after its sale to IntercontinentalExchange Inc ( ICE.N ). 
 The departing executives, who also include the exchange's global HR head, will receive termination payments, NYSE Euronext said in a regulatory filing. NYSE is being bought by ICE, the Atlanta-based derivatives market and clearing house operator, in a deal valued at about $10.6 billion. Geltzeiler, who has worked with NYSE for five years, will join home-security company ADT Corp ( ADT.N ) as CFO in November, ADT said on Monday. Shares of NYSE Euronext closed at $44.49 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. They have risen more than 6 percent in the last three months.
