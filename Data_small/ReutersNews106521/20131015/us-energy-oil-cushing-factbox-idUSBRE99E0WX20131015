 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cushing, the world's largest oil storage hub, has always been critical for traders given its role as the delivery point of the U.S. benchmark oil futures. 
 But focus on the hub has rarely been greater after an unprecedented three-month drawdown in stockpiles that fueled talk of squeezes on immediate supplies and fears that oil in storage could be drawn to minimal levels.

Most oil storage tanks have floating roofs that rise and fall with the amount of oil in the tank. The roofs have "feet" which are not supposed to "land" on the tank bottom. "There's always a portion of the oil that isn't reachable, you'd never pump a tank dry. It varies in terms of the design of the tank but I would say it's about 10 percent," said Mark Shaw, executive director at E3 Consulting LLC, an engineering firm that has reviewed designs of Cushing tanks. A spokesman for Magellan Midstream Partners ( MMP.N ), the third largest storage operator at Cushing with capacity of 12 million barrels, said its facilities would need up to 10 percent volume of the shell capacity to "maintain normal operations". But, Shaw said operators would usually have another extra few percentage points to maintain a practical level. With total shell capacity at almost 80 million barrels, according to Reuters calculations (see above), that would point to a minimum operational level of at least 8 million barrels. Vikas Dwivedi, analyst at Macquarie Capital, estimates the minimum at 16 million barrels based on calculating how much is needed for maintaining floating roofs and enabling smooth operations at optimal pressure levels. In a research note issued earlier this week, Dwivedi said stocks at Cushing could fall to 20 million barrels by the end of November. "If Cushing levels test operational minimums, the WTI-Brent spread could go positive," he wrote in the note. (Reporting by  Sabina Zawadzki ; Editing by  Bob Burgdorfer )
