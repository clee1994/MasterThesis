 LONDON  (Reuters) - British finance minister George Osborne hit back on Tuesday at criticism that the government sold a chunk of postal service operator Royal Mail ( RMG.L ) too cheaply. 
 Osborne, speaking at a Thomson Reuters Newsmaker event, said initial public offers are routinely offered at a discount and the government had followed advice from its bankers on details of the sale. "On all fronts it has been a great success" which would boost investment in the company, he said. (Writing by  William Schomberg ; editing by  Patrick Graham )
