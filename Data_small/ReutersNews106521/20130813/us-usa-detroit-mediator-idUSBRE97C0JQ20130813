 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The judge overseeing Detroit's bankruptcy case named a federal judge, Gerald Rosen, as the judicial mediator in the city's Chapter 9 proceedings, according to a court filing on Tuesday. 
 Rosen would have a chance to be an authoritative voice in what is likely to be a contentious case, the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. (Reporting by Joseph Lichterman; Additional reporting by  Deepa Seetharaman ; Editing by John Wallace)
