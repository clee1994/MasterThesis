 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to raise incomes by 3 percent annually and set up special economic zones to attract foreign businesses in the third tranche of measures aimed at boosting growth in the world's third-biggest economy. 
 Abe is also considering a push for public pensions and other public funds - a pool of $2 trillion - to increase returns by raising investment in equities, a government draft growth strategy showed, confirming a Reuters report. The following are main steps in the growth program, including those already announced by Abe or his advisors, to be approved by the cabinet next week. PUBLIC FUNDS - To seek experts' views on whether public pensions and other public funds should seek higher returns by raising their investment in equities, and aim to reach a conclusion by autumn. INCOME - Targets annual gains of 3 percent or more in gross national income per capita, which would be an increase of 1.5 million yen ($15,000) over 10 years from around 3.84 million yen in 2012. PRIVATE SECTOR/INVESTMENT - Set up special economic zones to attract foreign businesses. Review regulations and tax systems and take necessary action in the zones to create an international business environment. - Aim to boost the total value of infrastructure projects that involve private finance initiatives (PFIs) and public-private partnership (PPP) by 3 times to 12 trillion yen ($120.5 billion) over the next 10 years by steps including the selling of rights to operate some facilities such as airports and expressways. - Focus on boosting domestic private investment over the next three years and target for private-sector investment of 70 trillion yen annually, the level before the 2008 financial crisis and up about 10 percent from current levels. - Promote business start-ups and consider steps to boost investment in them. - Pledge to minimize investment of government funds in firms to avoid bailouts of "zombie" companies that are failing. FREE TRADE - Double the balance of inward foreign direct investment to 35 trillion yen by 2020. - Hit a target of 70 percent of exports covered by free trade deals by 2018, compared with around 19 percent, by pushing the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Economic Partnership (TPP) and other trade deals with the European Union, China and South Korea, and aim to create an Asia-Pacific free trade area. - Triple infrastructure exports to 30 trillion yen by 2020. "COOL JAPAN" - Triple overseas sales of "Cool Japan" content such as anime in five years. - Aim to boost the number of foreign visitors to Japan to 20 million a year from about 8 million now. LABOUR - Promote the smooth shift of workers to growth sectors from mature business areas without creating unemployment. - Review criteria for approval of permanent residency such as to shorten the duration of stay in Japan required to three years from five years to encourage high-skilled foreigners to keep working in the country.

WOMEN - Set a goal of reducing the waiting list at day care centers to zero by 2017 to make it easier for women to work and raise children. - Promote extending periods of childcare leave to last up to three years. - Increase the employment rate of females aged 25 to 44 to 73 percent by 2020 from 68 percent.
