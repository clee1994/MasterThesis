 LONDON  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) on Wednesday said it would recall 4,947 of its UK-registered Prius vehicles due to a brake glitch. 
 Toyota said the brake in the recalled vehicles may not work as well as it is supposed to because a part used in the electronic brake system may not be strong enough, and could crack. The Japanese company said the recall affects 4,947 UK-registered third generation Prius built between March and October 2009. (Reporting by  Rhys Jones ; editing by Brenda Goh)
