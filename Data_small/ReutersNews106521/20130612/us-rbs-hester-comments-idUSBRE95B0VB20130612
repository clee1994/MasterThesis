 LONDON  (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) Chief Executive Stephen Hester said he would have liked to have stayed at the bank beyond this year to oversee its privatization, but said it made sense to look for a successor before that process. 
 RBS said on Wednesday Hester will leave later this year. "Of course I'd like to have stayed as I feel I've been in the trenches with all of my people helping RBS to recover and privatization would have been a fitting end to those endeavours," Hester said in a video posted by the bank. "But it has been a very bruising and difficult job so I certainly don't have to be prized away reluctantly." (Reporting by  Steve Slater ; Editing by Matt Scuffham)
