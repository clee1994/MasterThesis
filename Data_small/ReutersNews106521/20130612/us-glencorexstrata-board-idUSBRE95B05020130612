 LONDON  (Reuters) - Glencore Xstrata ( GLEN.L ) has appointed former Morgan Stanley boss John Mack as an independent director, bringing in a Wall Street heavyweight as it rebuilds the board of the recently merged company. 
 Less than a month after a shareholder vote ousted all former Xstrata directors, the commodities miner and trader said on Wednesday it had appointed three new directors, including Mack, but also Peter Grauer - another investment banking veteran, now chairman of information provider Bloomberg - and Peter Coates, a veteran of the commodities group. Mack and Grauer bring Wall Street expertise to the board as independent non-executive directors. Coates, who is charged with the integration of Glencore and Xstrata, will be an executive director. A former chief executive and chairman who led Morgan Stanley through the financial crisis, Mack left the bank - still one of Glencore's key advisers - in 2011, but has taken on other roles in the financial services industry, including as adviser to private equity group KKR. Peter Grauer, a veteran of now defunct investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and CSFB Private Equity, has been Bloomberg chairman for over a decade. Coates is a 45-year veteran of the resource industry, formerly head of Xstrata's coal business before retiring in 2008. He stepped down as chairman of Australian oil and gas firm Santos ( STO.AX ) to take the executive role. The group said its search for a new chairman continues, as it consults with major investors after the abrupt exit of former Xstrata chairman John Bond last month.
