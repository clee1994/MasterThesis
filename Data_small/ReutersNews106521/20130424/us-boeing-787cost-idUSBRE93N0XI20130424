 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday that most of the costs associated with fixing the 787 Dreamliner battery system were reflected in first-quarter results released earlier in the day. 
 "We managed to absorb this," Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said in a conference call. The costs were included partly in research and development costs for the quarter, which fell compared with a year earlier. The cost will be spread over a about 1,100 planes, and that number will increase slightly, Smith said, without providing a figure. (Reporting by  Alwyn Scott ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
