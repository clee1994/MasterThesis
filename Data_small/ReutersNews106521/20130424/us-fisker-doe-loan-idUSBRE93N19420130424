 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Department of Energy continued to provide funds to Fisker Automotive even after the company failed to meet key production benchmarks in early 2011, according to a document released at a congressional hearing on Wednesday. 
 The document from the energy agency showed Fisker was given $32 million even after the "green" carmaker failed to launch its Karma electric vehicle in February 2011 as planned. The document was provided to reporters during a House Oversight Committee hearing on the government's loans to the troubled carmaker.
