 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday vacated a trial court's decision to certify a class action against railroad companies, a procedural win for the companies in a case about whether they illegally colluded to fix the price of fuel surcharges. 
 A unanimous panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sent the lawsuit back to the trial court to reconsider the matter in light of a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision about class actions. (Reporting by  David Ingram ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
