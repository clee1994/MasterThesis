 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Daimler's ( DAIGn.DE ) luxury brand Mercedes-Benz sold the most cars in one month in its history in September, German paper Bild reported on Thursday. 
 The carmaker sold over 142,000 cars last month, a rise of 15.9 percent, driven by demand in China and the United States, particularly for Mercedes' A-, C- and CLA class cars, the paper said. "The figures are in the right ballpark," a spokeswoman for Daimler said, adding sales data were due to be published on Friday.
