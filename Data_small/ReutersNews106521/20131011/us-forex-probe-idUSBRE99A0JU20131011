 LONDON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has begun a criminal investigation into possible manipulation of the foreign exchange market, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing a person familiar with the matter. 
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation is in the early stages of the probe into the currency market, Bloomberg said. The source did not specify which banks may be under scrutiny, it added. (Reporting by  Alexander Smith ; Editing by  Matthew Tostevin )
