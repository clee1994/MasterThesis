 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - WASHINGTON  Oct 11 (Reuters) - The United States felt it appropriate to mention in the Group of 20 communique that it must quickly resolve a looming fiscal crisis, a senior U.S. Treasury official said on Friday. 
 The communique released earlier in the day singled out the United States as needing "to take urgent action to address short-term fiscal uncertainties." U.S. officials thought this was warranted because they agree it is imperative for the United States to raise a cap on government borrowing, the official said. If Congress and the Obama administration don't reach a deal soon to raise America's $16.7 trillion cap on government borrowing, the country could begin defaulting on its obligations by the end of the month. The two-day G20 meeting, which concluded on Friday, was dominated by concerns over America's political crisis. (Reporting by  Jason Lange ; Editing by  Andrea Ricci )
