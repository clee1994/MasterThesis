 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) is considering increasing its stake in its car joint venture with China's state-owned FAW Group, VW Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn was quoted on Sunday as saying. 
 "Volkswagen and FAW want to extend their partnership. We are examining right now various possibilities on how we can expand our cooperation," Winterkorn said in an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
