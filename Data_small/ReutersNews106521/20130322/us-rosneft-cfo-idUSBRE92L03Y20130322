 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Dmitry Avdeyev, who has been managing finances at Russia's biggest oil producer Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ) since June 2012, has left the company after it completed the $55 billion acquisition of TNK-BP TNBP.MM, local press reported on Friday. 
 Kommersant business daily, citing unidentified sources, tipped Svyatoslav Slavinsky, a senior banking services executive with Citigroup ( C.N ) in Russia, as Rosneft's new vice president for finances. Vedomosti daily said Avdeyev, a former investment banker at  Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), left by "by mutual consent". A Rosneft spokesman declined to comment. Rosneft said on Thursday it had completed the acquisition of TNK-BP from BP ( BP.L ) and the AAR consortium of Soviet-born tycoons, the biggest deal in Russia's corporate history.
