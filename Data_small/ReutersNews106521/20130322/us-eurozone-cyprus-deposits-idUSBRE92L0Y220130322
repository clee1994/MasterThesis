 NICOSIA  (Reuters) - Cypriot leaders are discussing with their international lenders the adoption of a levy of more than 10 percent on bank deposits over 100,000 euros ($130,000), a ruling party official said on Friday, as the island scrambles to clinch a European Union bailout. 
 "We're trying to safeguard the provident (pension) funds in Cyprus Popular Bank, which are valued at over 600 million euros," the source added. (Reporting by  Michele Kambas ; Writing by Matt Robinson)
