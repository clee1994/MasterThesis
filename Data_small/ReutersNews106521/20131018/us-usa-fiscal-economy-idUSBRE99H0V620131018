 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve said on Friday it would issue its September report on U.S. industrial production on October 28. 
 The report, which was originally scheduled for release on Thursday, was delayed because some of the government data needed to compile it was not available due to the partial shutdown of the government. (Reporting by Timothy Ahmann)
