 JOHNSTOWN, Pennsylvania  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve added to market uncertainty by not following through on its hints that it could cut back on the pace of asset purchases in September, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said on Tuesday. 
 "We added another element of policy uncertainty and volatility into the marketplace that we didn't need to do," he said in response to questions after a speech. (Reporting By  Pedro Nicolaci da Costa ; Editing by  Chris Reese )
