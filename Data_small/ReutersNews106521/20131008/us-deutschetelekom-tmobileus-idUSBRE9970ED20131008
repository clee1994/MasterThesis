 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom said on Tuesday it is offering for sale a portion of the T-Mobile USA bonds from its holdings worth $3.1 billion. 
 The company said it would offer two series of $1.25 billion each and one of $600 million. "The proceeds of the sale of the bonds will serve Deutsche Telekom's general corporate purposes," the company said in a statement. Deutsche Telekom said it would offer $1.25 billion worth of senior notes due in 2019 and another portion of $1.25 billion notes, which are due in 2021. The remaining $600 million notes are due in 2023. The notes are part of the deal to buy MetroPCS, which Deutsche Telekom combined with its T-Mobile USA unit. As part of the transaction Deutsche Telekom provided T-Mobile USA, with debt capital in the form of bonds totaling $11.2 billion. Credit analysts have warned that Deutsche Telekom should sell some of that debt to the market to maintain its current credit profile.
