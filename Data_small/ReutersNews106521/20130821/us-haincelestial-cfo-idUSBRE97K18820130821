 (Reuters) - Perfume maker Elizabeth Arden Inc's ( RDEN.O ) Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Smith, will join food maker Hain Celestial Group Inc ( HAIN.O ). 
 In a statement released by Arden, Smith called the Hain job an "unexpected opportunity". Hain, which reported better-than-expected quarterly results, said Smith's appointment is effective September 3. Elizabeth Arden said Smith, who was its CFO since 2001, will stay through September 1 and it has started searching for his successor. Hain announced the retirement of CFO Ira Lamel last September. Smith leaves Arden after the company posted weaker-than-expected results and forecasts this month as orders from Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) fell. Hain's shares were up 5 percent at $76.69 in extended trading. Elizabeth Arden's shares closed at $34.83 on the Nasdaq on Wednesday.
