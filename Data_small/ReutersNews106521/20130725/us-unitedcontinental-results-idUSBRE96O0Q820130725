 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - United Continental Holdings Inc ( UAL.N ) on Thursday posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as costs fell and it raised fares, sending shares up 3 percent Thursday morning. 
 The world's biggest air carrier said second-quarter revenue rose 0.6 percent to $10 billion, the highest ever for that period. The average airfare rose 3.5 percent to $289.46. United has been working to win back customers who turned to rivals after technology glitches hurt customer service last year. The company made a number of changes to integrate as one carrier following the 2010 merger of UAL and Continental that formed it, including converting to a new computer reservation system. In a fast consolidating industry, Wall Street is looking out for signs that United has moved beyond its merger related issues to make progress in revenue and profits. Rival Delta ( DAL.N ) has moved ahead after its merger with Northwest and said in May it plans to return $1 billion to shareholders over the next three years. American and US Airways are in line to merge pending government approval. United Continental's passenger revenue per available seat mile at United, a key measure of performance in the airline industry, increased one percent. Net income was $469 million, or $1.21 a share, for the quarter, up from $339 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, profit was $1.35 a share, compared with $1.29 a share expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating costs fell 1 percent, with fuel expenses falling 10 percent. Shares of Chicago based United rose 2.9 percent to $35.50 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
