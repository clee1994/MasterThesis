 (Reuters) - Mead Johnson Nutrition Co ( MJN.N ) reported lower second-quarter earnings on Thursday, hurt by a decline in sales in North America and Europe. 
 The maker of the Enfamil brand of baby formula said net income was $162.2 million, or 80 cents per share, down from $165.8 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier. Net sales rose to $1.06 billion from $1.01 billion. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller  in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
