 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of several Boeing suppliers fell on Friday, after a fire broke out aboard a Dreamliner 787 aircraft parked at London's Heathrow airport, recalling a series of previous fires that had grounded Boeing's most advanced jet for months. 
 Boeing ( BA.N ) shares fell 3.1 percent to $103.58 in afternoon trading in New York, after earlier dropping as much as 7.4 percent. Metal components manufacturer Precision Castparts Corp ( PCP.N ), a primary supplier to Boeing, dropped as much as 6.4 percent before trading down 3.2 percent at $229.73 in heavy afternoon trading. Spirit AeroSystems Holdings ( SPR.N ), one of the manufacturers of parts for the Dreamliner, was down 2.1 percent at $22.65 in brisk trading, after earlier dropping as much as 4.7 percent. Other companies were barely affected. Shares of Honeywell International ( HON.N ) and Rockwell Collins ( COL.N ), among the largest companies that supply parts for the Dreamliner, were down only marginally. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all Dreamliners on January 16 after a string of fires linked to the jet's batteries. The planes were grounded for more than three months.
