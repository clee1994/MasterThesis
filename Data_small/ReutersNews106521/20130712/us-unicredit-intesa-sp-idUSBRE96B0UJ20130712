 MILAN  (Reuters) - Rating agency Standard & Poor's cut its credit ratings on the two biggest Italian banks, UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ) and Intesa Sanpaolo ( ISP.MI ), as well as that of insurer Generali ( GASI.MI ), following its downgrade of Italy's sovereign rating. 
 Ratings for UniCredit SpA, the parent company of UniCredit, and the long-term rating of Intesa Sanpaolo, were lowered to 'BBB' from 'BBB+', both with a negative outlook, the two lenders said on Friday. Generali ( GASI.MI ) was reduced to 'A-' from 'A', with a negative outlook, Italy's biggest insurer said in a statement. The moves followed an S&P downgrade of Italy's sovereign credit rating to BBB from BBB+, with a negative outlook, on Tuesday. In a separate statement, S&P said it also downgraded Mediobanca ( MDBI.MI ) and put on creditwatch with a negative implication 23 Italian lenders, including Mediobanca, Banca Popolare di Milano ( PMII.MI ), Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna ( EMII.MI ), Banco Popolare ( BAPO.MI ), Credito Emiliano ( EMBI.MI ) and Ubi Banca ( UBI.MI ). "We expect to resolve the creditwatch placements over the coming weeks," said the ratings agency. Together with its downgrade, S&P revised down its economic outlook for Italy, projecting growth to contract 1.9 percent this year, compared with the government's forecast for a 1.3-percent fall in output.
