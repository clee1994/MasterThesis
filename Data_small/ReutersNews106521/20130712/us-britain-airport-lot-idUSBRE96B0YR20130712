 WARSAW  (Reuters) - Polish flag carrier LOT LOT.UL said on Friday it would continue to operate its four Boeing ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliners after a Dreamliner operated by Ethiopian Airlines caught fire at Britain's Heathrow. 
 "We are not concerned by this incident," said LOT spokeswoman Barbara Pijanowska-Kuras. "Our Dreamliners will continue flying." LOT was the first European airline to take delivery of the 787 last year. Aircraft graphic:  link.reuters.com/rax39t (Reporting by Chris Borowski; Editing by  Gary Hill )
