 PARIS  (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney ( UTX.N ) said at the Paris Airshow on Tuesday that LATAM Airlines Group SA LAN.SN selected its geared turbofan engines to power 42 Airbus A320-family aircraft. 
 The decision will mean 84 more orders worth about $1.4 billion for the Pratt engine, which gained 730 orders on Monday as it was picked to power next-generation Embraer ( EMBR3.SA ) E-Jet. (Reporting by  Alwyn Scott ; Editing by  James Regan )
