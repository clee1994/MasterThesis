 PARIS  (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer ( EMBR3.SA ) announced deals for more than a dozen of its current passenger jets worth nearly $700 million at list prices on Tuesday, as it filled out its order book until the second-generation E-Jets arrive in 2018. 
 The contracts were dwarfed by the 365 potential orders for the next-generation planes unveiled at the Paris Airshow on Monday, but are key to maintaining production levels while Embraer develops its new line-up. Destined for India, Lithuania, Venezuela and Japan, the new orders underscored the reach of Embraer's E-Jets to more than 65 countries, helped by leasing arrangements for upstart regional carriers as demand slumps from major customers in Europe. Venezuelan state airline Conviasa confirmed options for seven E-190s in addition to its six jets in service. Embraer also unveiled two contracts that it had booked without disclosing. Japan Airlines ( 9201.T ) added four more E-170 orders for a total of 15 aircraft. India's Air Costa acquired two E-170s through Embraer subsidiary ECC Leasing and bought an E-190. Lithuania's Air Lituanica is also leasing an E-175 from ECC and an E-170 from a third party. (Reporting by Brad Haynes; Editing by  James Regan )
