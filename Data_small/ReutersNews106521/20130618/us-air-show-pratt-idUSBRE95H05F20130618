 PARIS  (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney ( UTX.N ) said on Tuesday that it expects to log 1,000 orders for its geared turbo fan aircraft engine at the Paris Airshow, adding to a backlog of 3,500 engines. 
 The company was chosen to power the next-generation Embraer ( EMBR3.SA ) E-Jet, which launched on Monday with up to 365 potential orders. The geared turbo fan engine is also on the Bombardier ( BBDb.TO ) CSeries jet due for first flight later this month, and three other platforms. Pratt & Whitney added that revenue was expected to double to more than $24 billion by 2020 from $12.2 billion in 2010 as production rises to levels not seen since the 1980s.
