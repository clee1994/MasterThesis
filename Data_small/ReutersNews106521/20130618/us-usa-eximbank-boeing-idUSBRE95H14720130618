 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday let stand a decision by the U.S. Export-Import Bank to finance the sale of 30 Boeing ( BA.N ) wide-body jets to Air India in a legal challenge brought by Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ). 
 "I am gratified by the court's recognition that these transactions should not be impeded by litigation," Fred Hochberg, chairman and president of Ex-Im Bank, said in a statement after the ruling. However, the court directed the government-run bank to better explain its rationale for the loans, which Delta claimed as a victory in its long-running spat with Ex-Im Bank. "The Bank now will be required to take the complaints of industry participants seriously before proceeding with potentially harmful subsidies to foreign airlines," Delta said in a statement Delta alleged in its suit that Ex-Im had failed to consider the economic impact of its loan guarantees. It initially sought to stop $3.4 billion in preliminary and final Ex-Im Bank loan guarantees to help India acquire the aircraft. The Atlantic-based carrier says it is hurt by Ex-Im Bank programs that allow foreign carriers to buy Boeing jets on easier credit terms than it can get. The appeals court said it was directing Ex-Im Bank to better explain its decision for the loans "without vacating any of the Bank's actions in this matter to date." But it added: "The Bank's actions on remand of course will be subject to later judicial review if an aggrieved party wishes to challenge the Bank's actions as unlawful."
