 PARIS  (Reuters) - Ryanair ( RYA.I ) said on Tuesday that it will finalize an order for 175 Boeing ( BA.N ) 737-800 aircraft worth around $16 billion at list prices at the Paris Airshow on Wednesday. 
 The Irish budget airline made a provisional order in March for the aircraft, which would help it continue its domination of the European low-cost airline market. (Reporting by Siva Govindasamy; Editing by  James Regan )
