 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Nearly 95 percent of bondholders had signed up for a debt swap to lighten Greece's debt burden an hour before the 2000 GMT deadline expired, a senior Greek government official said on Thursday. 
 "About an hour before the deadline expired, the participation rate was nearing 95 percent and responses were still coming in," a Greek government official told Reuters. That meant Greece had easily topped the 90 percent target for participation it had set itself, in a major boost for the debt-stricken country.
