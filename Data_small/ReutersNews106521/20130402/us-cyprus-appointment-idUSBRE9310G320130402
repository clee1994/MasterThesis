 NICOSIA  (Reuters) - Cyprus appointed Harris Georgiades as finance minister, replacing Michael Sarris who resigned earlier on Tuesday. 
 Georgiades will be sworn in on Wednesday, a government statement said. Georgiades was labor minister and deputy finance minister in Cyprus's government, which assumed power barely a month ago and is coping with a severe banking crisis after imposing losses on depositors as part of its 10-billion euro EU/IMF bailout.
