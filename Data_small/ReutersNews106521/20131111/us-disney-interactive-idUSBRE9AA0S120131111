 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Media company Walt Disney Co said on Monday it had reorganized its interactive unit, which houses video games and online properties, and that Co-President John Pleasants will leave his current post. 
 Disney said it consolidated the unit's video game and media groups under Jimmy Pitaro, the division's other co-president. Pleasants will serve as a consultant to the business. The two were appointed co-presidents in October 2010 to turn around the money-losing unit. The interactive unit reported a profit for the quarter that ended in September, earning $16 million after losing $76 million a year ago, partially on sales of its ambitious new Disney Infinity console game. The company said it has sold more than 1 million Infinity starter packs. Disney shares slipped 0.4 percent to $68.31 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.
