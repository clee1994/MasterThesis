 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) stopped selling some of its products through Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) because it felt the online retailer was not doing enough to stop third-party merchants from selling damaged or expired J&J merchandise, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. 
 Citing people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said J&J has resumed selling some of the items on Amazon.com, but the disagreements have yet to be fully resolved. In July, Amazon's CFO said business generated from third-party merchants accounted for about 40 percent of items sold in the second quarter. Amazon and J&J could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by  Michael Erman ; Editing by  Edwina Gibbs )
