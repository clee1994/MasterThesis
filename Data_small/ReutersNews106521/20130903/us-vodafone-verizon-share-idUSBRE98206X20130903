 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares in Vodafone ( VOD.L ) opened 1.2 percent down on Tuesday after Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ) agreed to pay $130 billion to buy the British company out of its U.S. wireless business, Verizon Wireless. 
 Vodafone shares fell to 209.5 pence, valuing the company at around 101 billion pounds ($157.20 billion). Vodafone shares had risen to their highest level since April 2001 on Monday. Verizon Communications agreed on Monday to buy Vodafone out of Verizon Wireless in a cash and shares agreement - history's third largest corporate deal. For the British group, the accord will allow it to return 71 percent of the net proceeds, or $84 billion including all of the stock, to shareholders while also ramping up investment in its networks to set itself apart from rivals.
