 (Reuters) - Britain's ICAP Plc ( IAP.L ) may pay less than $100 million to settle a civil probe into the broker-dealer's alleged role in the manipulation of a key interest rate, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the settlement talks. 
 The agreement could come as soon as Wednesday and would be the fourth in an investigation into the alleged manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and other benchmarks on which are based interest rates for trillions of dollars of loans.
