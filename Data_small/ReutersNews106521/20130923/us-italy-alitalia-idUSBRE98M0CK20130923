 MILAN  (Reuters) - Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) will strengthen its role in Italian airline Alitalia SpA CAITLA.UL, Italian transport minister Maurizio Lupi said on Monday. 
 "I expect that Air France will strongly reaffirm that Alitalia is a strategic asset for Air France, and therefore that there will be a strengthening of Air France's role," Lupi said at the margins of an industry conference in Milan. Air France-KLM owns 25 percent of the loss-making Alitalia following the Italian firm's rescue from bankruptcy in 2008, and media reports have predicted the Franco-Dutch group will decide what to do with its stake in the coming week.
