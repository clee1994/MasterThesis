 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Canadian Industry Minister James Moore on Monday declined to comment on a tentative deal to take struggling smartphone maker BlackBerry Ltd ( BB.TO ) private. 
 "We have no comment at this time," Moore spokeswoman Jessica Fletcher said in an e-mail. Separately, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty told reporters in Toronto that he did not comment on private business matters. He made the remark when pressed about news that a consortium led by Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd ( FFH.TO ) wanted to buy BlackBerry for $4.7 billion.
