 SAO PAULO  (Reuters) - Brazil's Embraer SA ( EMBR3.SA ), the world's third-largest commercial planemaker, booked an order from United Airlines on Monday for 30 regional jets, the latest in a string of orders for smaller aircraft by major U.S. airlines. 
 The E-175 jets will form part of the United Express fleet controlled by industry leader United Continental ( UAL.N ). The order includes options for as many as 40 additional aircraft for a total of $2.9 billion at current list prices. (Reporting by Brad Haynes)
