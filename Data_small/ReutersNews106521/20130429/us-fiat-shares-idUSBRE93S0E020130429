 MILAN  (Reuters) - Shares of Italian automaker Fiat ( FIA.MI ) turned negative in midday trading after its U.S. unit Chrysler posted worse-than-expected first quarter results. 
 At 8:37 a.m. EDT, Fiat shares were down 1.6 percent at 4.61 euros, after having traded 1.2 percent higher before Chrysler said its first quarter net income fell 65 percent to $166 million on new product launches. "The Chrysler results were worse than we thought," said an analyst. (Reporting by Jennifer Clark, editing by Antonella Ciancio)
