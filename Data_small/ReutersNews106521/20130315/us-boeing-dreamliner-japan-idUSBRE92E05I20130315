 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Civil Aviation Bureau said on Friday it is not yet at the stage where it can estimate when commercial flights for Boeing Co's Dreamliner jet would resume after the plane was grounded globally for battery problems. 
 Boeing said earlier in the day that it expected the certification process for its proposed battery fix on the 787 jet to be completed in weeks. (Reporting by Tim Kelly; Writing by  James Topham ; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
