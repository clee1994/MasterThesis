 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Shares in Samsung Electronics rose 2 percent on Monday, driven by expectations that the South Korean technology giant will continue to post solid earnings after its record-high profit in the July to September period, analysts said. 
 Some analysts raised their target prices for Samsung, expecting a strong recovery in its memory chip business to help offset slowing growth of smartphone profits in the coming quarters. Samsung shares rose as much as 2 percent to 1,478,000 Korean won ($1,400) per share, the highest intraday level in a week. (Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Jungmin Jang; Editing by  Richard Pullin )
