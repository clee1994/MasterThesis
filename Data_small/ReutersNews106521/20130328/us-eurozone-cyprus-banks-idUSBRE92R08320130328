 NICOSIA  (Reuters) - Banks in Cyprus opened their doors on Thursday for the first time in almost two weeks, with tight controls on transactions to prevent a run on deposits after the island was forced to accept a stringent EU rescue package to avert bankruptcy. 
 In central Nicosia, queues of at least a dozen people had formed outside branches of the country's two biggest lenders, Bank of Cyprus and Cyprus Popular Bank, also known as Laiki. (Writing by Matt Robinson)
