 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) has no plans right now to dismantle its Infrastructure & Cities division, its chief executive reiterated in a company newsletter, brushing off a recent press report. 
 "I have already made it clear, numerous times, that changing the IC Sector structure is not a priority for me," Joe Kaeser said in the newsletter distributed on Thursday. Germany's Manager Magazin reported earlier this month that Siemens planned to dismantle the Infrastructure & Cities division and was reviewing other businesses.
