 (Reuters) - The Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) said on Tuesday it will begin production in Myanmar as part of a planned $200 million investment in the Asian country. 
 The new facility is the first to locally bottle Coca-Cola in more than six decades and follows the U.S. company's re-entry into Myanmar last year. Following the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, Coca-Cola said it became one of the first U.S. companies to be granted an investment permit under Myanmar's new Foreign Investment Law.
