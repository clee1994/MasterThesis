 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The third-tranche of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's growth strategy, set to be unveiled on Wednesday, will likely focus on the creation of special economic zones where deregulation and tax cuts can be implemented in designated places such as big cities. 
 Japan may also urge the nation's public funds to review their investment strategy to raise their holdings of equities and overseas assets as part of a growth strategy. Abe has said he wants to announce the growth strategy, the so-called Third Arrow of the "Abenomics" prescription of aggressive monetary and fiscal policies, before the June 17-18 Group of Eight nations summit in Northern Ireland. The following are main steps expected to be part of the growth program, including those already announced by Abe or his advisors. PUBLIC FUND - Urge public pension funds - a pool of more than $2 trillion - to increase their investment in equities and overseas assets, according to people with knowledge of the policy shift. - Create a panel by July to consider the investment strategies of public funds, which, like other Japanese institutional investors, have relied heavily on buying Japanese government bonds in recent years. PRIVATE SECTOR/INVESTMENT - Focus on the next five years as a structural reform period and set up special economic zones where bold deregulation and lower corporate taxes can be implemented. (Nikkei) - Aim to boost the total value of infrastructure projects that involve private finance initiatives (PFIs) by 2.5 times to 12 trillion yen ($120.5 billion) over the next 10 years by selling the rights to operate some facilities such as airports and expressways. (Nikkei) - Pledge to minimize investment of government funds in firms to avoid bailouts of "zombie" companies that are failing.(Nikkei) - Focus on boosting domestic private investment over the next three years and target for private-sector investment of 70 trillion yen annually, the level before the 2008 financial crisis and up about 10 percent from current levels. FREE TRADE - Hit a target of 70 percent of exports covered by free trade deals by 2018, compared with around 19 percent, by pushing the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Economic Partnership (TPP) and other trade deals with the European Union, China and South Korea, and aim to create an Asia-Pacific free trade area. (Nikkei) - Triple infrastructure exports to 30 trillion yen by 2020. - Double the stock of foreign direct investment in Japan to 35 trillion yen by 2020.
