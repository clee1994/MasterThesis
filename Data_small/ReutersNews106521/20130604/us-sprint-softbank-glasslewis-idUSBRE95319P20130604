 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Glass Lewis on Tuesday told shareholders in Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ) not to vote on SoftBank Corp's ( 9984.T ) offer to buy the company at a special meeting on June 12, citing a rival bid from Dish Network ( DISH.O ). 
 Glass Lewis said it would be premature for Sprint shareholders to vote on SoftBank's proposed $20.1 billion purchase of 70 percent of Sprint while the company's board is still evaluating Dish's $25.5 billion counter bid. (Reporting By Sinead Carew)
