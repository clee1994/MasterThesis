 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ) has agreed to pay $85 million to settle an investor class action lawsuit accusing the private equity giant of not disclosing bad investments before its $4.7 billion initial public offering in 2007. 
 The settlement, disclosed in court papers filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, came in the run-up to a trial set to begin September 16. The proposed deal requires judicial approval. (Reporting by  Nate Raymond  in New York; Editing by  Gary Hill )
