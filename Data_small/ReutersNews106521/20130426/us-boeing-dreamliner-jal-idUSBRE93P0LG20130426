 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan Airlines Co Ltd ( 9201.T ) aims to return Boeing Co's ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliner jets to commercial flights in June, the company said in a statement on Friday. 
 Japanese authorities gave Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways ( 9202.T ) the green light to fly the 787 jets earlier on Friday following U.S. approval, after the jet was grounded since mid-January due to lithium-ion battery problems. (Reporting by  Yoko Kubota , editing by William Hardy)
