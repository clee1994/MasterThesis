 (Reuters) - Skeptics who think that Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ) is a bland stock should reconsider, according to a report in financial weekly Barron's October 28 edition. 
 The retail chain is undergoing a makeover that could set the stock up to rise more than 20 percent. With 1,158 stores in 49 states, Kohl's announced new personnel changes, including a former high-ranking Starbucks ( SBUX.O ) executive who is now the company's first chief customer officer. A current merchandise overhaul and shareholder-friendly practices like buybacks and dividends, should be a reason to "stick around," Barron's said. The stock could reach the mid- to high-$60 range, it said. Kohl's shares closed down 0.3 percent on Friday at $54.74. (Reporting by  Jennifer Saba  in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski)
