 (Reuters) - Shares of money manager BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) have even more room to climb, keeping up its recent streak, Barron's reported in its October 28 edition. 
 The firm's stock has been up 65 percent over a year ago and is trading at one of the highest multiples of its asset manager peers such as T. Rowe Price ( TROW.O ). Still, the financial newspaper said BlackRock's shares could rise another 15 percent. The reason is a healthy mix of funds, strong cash flow and a good management team. BlackRock stock closed nearly unchanged on Friday at $307.61. (Reporting by  Jennifer Saba  in New York; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
