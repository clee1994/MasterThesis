 MILAN  (Reuters) - A bomb threat on Tuesday at the Milan offices of Italy's stock market regulator Consob was a false alarm, a police spokesman said. 
 The offices were evacuated earlier on Tuesday after a telephoned bomb warning. The alert was called off after police with sniffer dogs searched the premises. (Reporting by Maria Pia Quaglia and  Ilaria Polleschi ; Editing by John Stonestreet)
