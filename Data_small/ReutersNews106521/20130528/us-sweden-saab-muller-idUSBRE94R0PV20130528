 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Former Saab Chairman Victor Muller will be called in to answer questions related to a Swedish inquiry into alleged tax offences at the bankrupt carmaker, the country's Economic Crime Authority said on Tuesday. 
 Muller, chief executive of the Spyker SPYKR.AS sports-car group that bought Saab from General Motors in 2010, is not suspected of wrongdoing. "The Gothenburg district attorney has confirmed that Mr Muller is not a suspect and may be invited for an interview after summer, possibly in October," Spyker said in a statement. Prosecutors are looking into allegations that executives at Saab, which collapsed in 2011, obstructed proper tax checks over the years 2010 to 2011. The period being examined was a turbulent time for the company, taking in its sale by General Motors and subsequent emergence of problems that led to its collapse. Katinka Wall, a spokeswoman at the Swedish Economic Crime Authority, confirmed that Muller would be summoned as part of the wider investigation and that he is not being served as a suspect. She declined to provide further details. Swedish prosecutors last week questioned Saab's former Chief Executive Jan-Ake Jonsson and two other executives as part of its tax investigation.
