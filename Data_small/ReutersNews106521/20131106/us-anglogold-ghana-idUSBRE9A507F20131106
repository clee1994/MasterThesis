 JOHANNESBURG  (Reuters) - Africa's top bullion producer, AngloGold Ashanti, ( ANGJ.J ) is "trying to close a sale" for its small Navachab operation in Namibia and is cutting 430 jobs at its troubled Obuasi mine in Ghana, its chief executive said on Wednesday. 
 Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan told journalists on a conference call after the group reported a swing back into profit in the third quarter that it had consulted with organized labor over the job cuts in Ghana. (Reporting by  Ed Stoddard ; Editing by  Ed Cropley )
