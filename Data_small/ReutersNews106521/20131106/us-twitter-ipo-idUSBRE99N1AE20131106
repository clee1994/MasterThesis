 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc on Wednesday priced its initial public offering above its expected range to raise more than $1.8 billion, according to a source, in a sign of strong investor demand for the most highly anticipated U.S. public float since Facebook Inc. 
 The microblogging network priced 70 million shares at $26, above the expected range of $23 to $25, which had already been raised once before. (Reporting by  Olivia Oran ; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
