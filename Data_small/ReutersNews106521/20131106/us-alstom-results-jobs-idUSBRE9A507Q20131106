 PARIS  (Reuters) - Alstom ( ALSO.PA ) plans to cut 1,300 jobs worldwide, mainly in Europe, as part of a cost-cutting drive that will see it sell a minority stake in its transport business, Chief Executive Patrick Kron said on Wednesday. 
 The group said it planned to raise 1 to 2 billion euros in asset sales by December 2014 after a lack of large orders hit first-half results. Kron told reporters on a conference call that the company's balance sheet was solid and that it did not need to raise fresh capital. (Reporting by Natalie Huet; Editing by  James Regan )
