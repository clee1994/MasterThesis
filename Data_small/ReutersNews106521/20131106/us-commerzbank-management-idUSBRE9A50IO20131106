 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany's Commerzbank ( CBKG.DE ) said Jochen Kloesges and Ulrich Sieber will leave by year end, shrinking the management board of the country's second-largest lender down to seven from nine members. 
 The board reduction is part of a broader restructuring drive to cut costs launched in November 2012, the bank said on Wednesday. (Reporting by  Edward Taylor )
