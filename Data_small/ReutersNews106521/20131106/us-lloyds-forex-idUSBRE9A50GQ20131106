 LONDON  (Reuters) - The UK's Lloyds Banking Group ( LLOY.L ) said it has opened an internal probe into its own currency trading after regulators started investigating possible manipulation in the market. 
 "We are aware that a number of regulatory and enforcement authorities are investigating foreign exchange trading and, as a result, we believe it is prudent to review our own foreign exchange trading over recent years and have commenced such a review," the bank said in a statement on Wednesday. It said it would report anything it finds to the relevant authorities and assist them as requested. Several banks, including Barclays ( BARC.L ) and UBS ( UBSN.VX ), have said they were cooperating with regulators investigating possible manipulation. At this stage, Lloyds is not part of the investigation, a person familiar with the matter said. (Reporting by  Steve Slater ; Editing by  Alexander Smith )
