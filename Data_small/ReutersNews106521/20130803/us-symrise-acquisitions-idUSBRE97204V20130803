 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German flavour and scent maker Symrise ( SY1G.DE ) is focusing its acquisition strategy on food technology start-ups in the Americas, Asia and in emerging markets - a particular target for sales growth, its chief executive told a German newspaper. 
 "We are focusing on smaller additions, for instance of start-ups with good technology," Welt am Sonntag quoted Heinz-Juergen Bertram as saying in an interview due out on Sunday. As part of its diversification into nutritional supplements, Symrise bought a 12 percent stake in Sweden's probiotics manufacturer Probi ( PROB.ST ) and a minority stake in Swedish food ingredient developer Indevex Biotech. Symrise aims to boost the proportion of sales from developing economies - the industry's fastest growing market - to about two thirds by 2020 from 50 percent now, he said. Group revenues were 1.7 billion euros ($2.3 billion) last year. In the $20 billion fragrance and flavour market, Symrise ranks fourth after Givaudan ( GIVN.VX ), IFF ( IFF.N ) and unlisted Firmenich. It sells cosmetic ingredients and scents that go into creams, shampoos and detergents made by groups such as Unilever ( ULVR.L ), Procter & Gamble ( PG.N ) and Colgate-Palmolive ( CL.N ).
