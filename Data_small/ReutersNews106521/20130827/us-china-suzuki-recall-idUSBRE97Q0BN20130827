 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - The Chinese venture of Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co Ltd ( 7267.T ) will recall more than 400,000 vehicles in China due to piston rod defects, China's quality watchdog said on Friday.

Dongfeng Honda Automobile Co Ltd will recall a total of 408,069 CR-V sport utility vehicles (SUVs) produced between March 2, 2010 and August 30, 2012, due to a possible facture in piston rods for shock absorbers, China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said in a statement on its website.
