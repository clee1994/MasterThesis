 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - A joint venture of EADS ( EAD.PA ) and ThyssenKrupp ( TKAG.DE ) and offices of Rheinmetall ( RHMG.DE ) were raided this week in Germany on suspicion of paying bribes related to an order of submarine equipment from Greece, a spokesman for the state prosecutor in Bremen said on Saturday. 
 The Atlas Elektronik joint venture and Rheinmetall Defence Electronics were searched as they are suspected of paying 18 million euros ($24 million) in bribes and of avoiding taxes, the prosecutor's spokesman said. He was confirming a report in German paper Sueddeutsche Zeitung. EADS and ThyssenKrupp both confirmed the raid on their unit, which they bought from BAE Systems ( BAES.L ). Rheinmetall was not available to comment, but Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported, citing a spokesman for the company, that it rejected the accusations. ThyssenKrupp said it had discovered the matter itself "as part of a compliance investigation" and notified the authorities in 2010 about it.
