 CAIRO  (Reuters) - Egypt will not discuss the possibility of an emergency loan with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and faces "no crisis" in importing essential imports, government spokesman Alaa El Hadidi said on Sunday. 
 He also said reports of possible financial support from Arab countries such as Libya and Iraq were "speculation", adding that Egypt wanted to boost investment from those countries. (Writing by  Ulf Laessing ; Editing by  Robin Pomeroy )
