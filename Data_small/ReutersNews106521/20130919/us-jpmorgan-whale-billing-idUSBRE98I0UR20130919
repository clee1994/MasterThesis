 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Thursday ordered JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) to refund about $309 million to credit-card customers who were billed for identity-theft protection services that they did not receive. 
 JPMorgan, which was fined $920 million by regulators earlier on Thursday over separate trading issues, also must pay a $20 million penalty to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and $60 million to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
