 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German construction and industrial services group Bilfinger SE ( GBFG.DE ) plans to cut 1,250 jobs worldwide, or just under 2 percent of its workforce, over the next two years as it seeks to cut sales and administration costs. 
 From 2015, the job cuts would save up to 90 million euros ($122 million) in personnel costs as well as a low to mid-double digit million euro amount in non-personnel costs, the company said in a statement on Thursday. Bilfinger had just under 67,000 employees at the end of 2012. ($1 = 0.7384 euros) (Reporting by  Jonathan Gould ; Editing by  Victoria Bryan )
