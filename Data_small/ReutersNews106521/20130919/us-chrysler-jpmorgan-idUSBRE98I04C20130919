 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) is likely to lead the underwriting of Chrysler Group LLC's initial public offering, CNBC reported late on Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the offer. 
 An IPO would bring to a head the battle between Sergio Marchionne, who leads both Chrysler and its main shareholder Fiat SpA ( FIA.MI ), and a healthcare trust fund affiliated with the United Auto Workers union. Chrysler plans to file documents this month that would allow its minority investor to sell shares in a stock market listing, a process that will slow Fiat's plans to take full control of the U.S. automaker. The trust, a type known as a voluntary employees' beneficiary association or VEBA, is unhappy with the price Fiat has offered for its Chrysler stake and is exercising its right to push Marchionne to take Chrysler public. A Chrysler spokeswoman declined comment to CNBC on the company's IPO.
