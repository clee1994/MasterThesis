 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan decided to compile an economic stimulus package worth around 5 trillion yen ($50.96 billion) to offset the impact from a sales tax hike planned next April, the government said in a statement on Tuesday. 
 The decision was made by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet hours after he said the government will raise the national sales tax to 8 percent in April from 5 percent in a bid to rein in the government's runaway debt. (Reporting by  Tetsushi Kajimoto ; Editing by Shinichi Saoshiro)
