 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) said on Wednesday that it is recalling 342,000 Tacoma pickup trucks to fix defective seat belts. 
 The models involved are Tacoma Access Cabs equipped with rear-hinged rear doors, built from 2004 to 2011. Toyota said a screw could come loose in the front seat belts on some of those trucks, causing the belts to malfunction. Toyota will notify customers by mail.
