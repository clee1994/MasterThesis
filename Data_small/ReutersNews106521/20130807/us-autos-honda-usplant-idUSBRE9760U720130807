 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) said on Wednesday it will invest about $215 million in its Ohio manufacturing operations to add new powertrain technology and two training centers. 
 The Japanese automaker said about $180 million will be spent at its Anna, Ohio, engine plant to expand capabilities in aluminum die casting and engine parts production, as well as to add a training center for powertrains. Honda also has started construction of a 160,000-square-foot building near its existing operations in Marysville, Ohio, that will house a training facility, office space and a heritage center highlighting the company's history in the state and country. The $35 million building is scheduled to open in the fall of 2014, Honda said. A company spokesman said the plans will create 10 jobs. (Reporting by  Ben Klayman  in Detroit; Editing by Gerald E.
