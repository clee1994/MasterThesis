 (Reuters) - Glenview Capital Partners rejected hospital operator Health Management Associates Inc's ( HMA.N ) offer to add a few of the hedge fund's nominees to its board, reiterating its demand for a complete overhaul of the board. 
 Glenview rejected the idea of a "hybrid board" including nominees from HMA, saying a shareholder vote was already underway to decide the outcome. HMA, which is being bought by larger peer Community Health Systems Inc ( CYH.N ) for $3.9 billion, has been under pressure from Glenview, which has said it wants to replace HMA's directors and set the company on a different course. Glenview, which owns a 14.6 percent stake in HMA, has opposed the Community Health offer, saying it "establishes an important floor value" that should serve as a basis for seeking greater value to HMA shareholders. HMA said that after discussions with shareholders it would approach Glenview with a proposal to add its nominees to the board. "HMA is prepared for one of the Glenview nominees to be Chairman of the Board," it said in a statement late on Tuesday. The hospital group last month urged shareholders to reject Glenview's attempts to replace the board, calling the hedge fund's actions a distraction. Spokespersons for Glenview and Community Health could not be reached for comment outside regular business hours.
