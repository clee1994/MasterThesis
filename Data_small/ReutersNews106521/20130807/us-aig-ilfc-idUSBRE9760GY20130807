 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - U.S. insurer American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) has extended the deadline for the sale of its $4.8 billion ILFC aircraft leasing unit to a Chinese consortium to August 31, Basis Point, a Thomson Reuters publication, reported on Wednesday, citing sources. 
 AIG Chief Executive Bob Benmosche said last week on a post-earnings conference call that the company was open to an initial public offering of the unit if a deal does not go through. The Chinese consortium, which has missed earlier deadlines, includes P3 Investments, New China Trust Co, one-fifth owned by Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) and China Aviation Industrial Fund.
