 (Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc ( MDLZ.O ), the maker of Cadbury chocolate, reported quarterly earnings that topped Wall Street views even while falling from a year earlier and dramatically raised its share buyback authorization on Wednesday. 
 The company said it is now authorized to buy back up to $6 billion of its stock through 2016, up from $1.2 billion previously. It expects to purchase $1 billion to $2 billion worth of stock annually. The company, which also makes Oreo cookies, reported a 40 percent drop in second-quarter earnings, saying it was boosting investments in advertising and to expand its distribution network in emerging markets. Net income was $616 million, or 34 cents per share, in the second quarter, down from $1.03 billion, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items including costs related to last year's spin-off of Kraft Foods Group Inc ( KRFT.O ), earnings were 37 cents per share. On that basis, analysts on average were expecting 34 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also raised its dividend by 8 percent. Mondelez shares rose 2 percent to $31.98 in after-hours trade from a close at $31.26 on the Nasdaq. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller  in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)
