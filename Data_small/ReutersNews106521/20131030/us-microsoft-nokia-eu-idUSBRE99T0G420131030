 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Microsoft has asked EU antitrust regulators to approve its 5.44-billion-euro ($7.49 billion) takeover of Nokia's phone business as part of a push into the mobile devices business. 
 The deal, announced last month, includes a 10-year licensing agreement of Nokia's patent portfolio. The European Commission said it would decide by December 4 whether to clear the acquisition. It can extend the review by 10 working days if Microsoft offers concessions to allay possible competition concerns. ($1 = 0.7262 euros) (Reporting by  Foo Yun Chee )
