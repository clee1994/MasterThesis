 WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White is eyeing a former adviser to ex-SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt as a potential contender for a key post in the division that oversees financial markets, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
 Joseph Lombard, a market structure expert at law firm Murphy & McGonigle, is considered to be a leading candidate for a position in the agency's Trading and Markets Division, three of those people said. A second name being floated for a possible job in the division is Chris Concannon, a former executive with Nasdaq OMX Group Inc who now works for high-frequency trading firm Virtu Financial LLC, according to three sources, who spoke anonymously because the discussions are non-public.
