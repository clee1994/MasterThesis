 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Prices for U.S. Treasuries added to gains on Friday after worse-than-expected retail sales data, with 30-year bonds rising one full point. 
 Benchmark 10-year notes rose 15/32 to yield 1.741 percent after the data. Prices for 30-year bonds jumped 1-06/32 to yield 2.938 percent. U.S. retail sales contracted in March for the second time in three months, a sign the American economy may have stumbled at the end of the first quarter.
