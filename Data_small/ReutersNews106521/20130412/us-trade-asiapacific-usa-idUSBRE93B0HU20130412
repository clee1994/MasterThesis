 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Japan has agreed to a "robust package of actions and agreements" to address U.S. concerns over access to its auto and insurance markets as part of a deal paving the way for Tokyo to join the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) talks, Acting U.S. Trade Representative Demetrios Marantis said on Friday. 
 "We are pleased to welcome Japan's participation in the TPP negotiations pending a consensus agreement among the current TPP members and the completion of our respective domestic processes," Marantis said in a statement. All 11 countries currently participating in the TPP talks have to agree to Japan's request to join, but getting U.S. support was Tokyo's biggest hurdle.
