 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Bob Evans Farms Inc ( BOBE.O ) are poised to extend their steep gains this year as an ongoing plan to remodel the company's namesake restaurants boosts same-store sales, financial weekly Barron's said on Sunday. 
 The company has updated about 70 percent of its restaurants, with the renovated locations posting same-store sales growth of about 2 percent, the publication said in its September 9 edition. Stores that have not been updated have seen sales fall 1 percent. Citing analysts at FrontFour Capital Group, Barron's wrote that the stock could climb 30 percent from its current levels. Bob Evans' shares closed Friday at $50.39 and are up 25 percent in 2013. (Reporting by  Ryan Vlastelica ; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
