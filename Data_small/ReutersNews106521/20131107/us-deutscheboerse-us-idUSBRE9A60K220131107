 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ) agreed on Thursday to pay $152 million to settle allegations by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that the company's Clearstream unit may have violated U.S. economic sanctions tied to Iran. 
 The German exchange operator received an offer from the United States in October after OFAC closed the investigation. (Reporting By  Thomas Atkins ; Editing by  Victoria Bryan )
