 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - US Airways ( LCC.N ) CEO Doug Parker will receive an estimated $19.5 million in merger-related pay for taking over as chief executive of the merged US Airways and American Airlines, the companies said Monday. 
 The merger between US Air and American parent AMR Corp ( AAMRQ.PK ), which still requires regulatory approval, would create the world's largest airline, with more than 6,700 daily flights to 336 destinations and 100,000 employees. (Reporting by  Alwyn Scott ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
