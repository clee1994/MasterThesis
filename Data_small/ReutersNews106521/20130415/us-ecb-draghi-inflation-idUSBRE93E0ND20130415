 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Monday said that inflation in the euro zone could experience going up and down in a volatile manner, but might average below the ECB's goal of just below 2 percent. 
 Referring to inflation, Draghi said in the question-and-answer session after a speech at the University of Amsterdam it might be "below 2 percent, on the low side ... We may have volatility, bumps." Draghi also said that the ECB's monetary policy is very accommodative, and added that early repayments on the ECB's 3-year loans were coming not only from banks headquartered in the euro zone core countries, but also from distressed countries.
