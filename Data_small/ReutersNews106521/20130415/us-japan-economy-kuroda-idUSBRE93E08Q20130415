 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday the financial sector's support of corporate and household activity is necessary for monetary policy to lead to higher economic growth. 
 There is still some uncertainty in global financial markets, so it is important for banks to practice good risk management, Kuroda said in a speech. (Reporting by Stanley White; Editing by  Ken Wills )
