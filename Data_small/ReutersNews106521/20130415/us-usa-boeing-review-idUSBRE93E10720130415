 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said on Monday his department will not rush its review of Boeing's ( BA.N ) plan to fix battery problems for its grounded 787 Dreamliner, but a decision could come "soon." 
 "We're not going to short circuit it, we're going to take our time," LaHood told reporters on the sidelines of a conference on advanced biofuels. "When we're finished reviewing their plan, we will announce it to the world." When asked about a timeline for a decision on Boeing's plan, LaHood said "soon."
