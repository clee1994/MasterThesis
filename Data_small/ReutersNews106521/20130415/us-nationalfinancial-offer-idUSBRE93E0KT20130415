 (Reuters) - Wealth management company National Financial Partners NFP.N said it agreed to be bought by private equity investment firm Madison Dearborn Partners LLC for about $1.3 billion, including convertible debt. 
 Madison Dearborn will pay $25.35 for each National Financial share, a premium of about 8 percent to the stock's Friday close. Reuters first reported on March 12 that New York-based National Financial was exploring a possible sale of the company to private equity firms. Madison's offer price is a premium of 26 percent to trading levels on that day. National Financial, which is run by Jessica Bibliowicz, the daughter of former Citigroup ( C.N ) chief Sandy Weill, faced difficulties during the downturn in 2008 and its stock hit a low of $1.21 that year. BofA Merrill Lynch was the financial adviser to National Financial. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP served as legal adviser to National Financial. UBS Securities LLC advised Madison Dearborn, while Ropes & Gray LLP served as its legal adviser. National Financial shares were up about 7 percent before the bell on Monday.
