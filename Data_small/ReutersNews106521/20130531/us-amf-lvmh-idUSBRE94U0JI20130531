 PARIS  (Reuters) - A panel of experts at French market regulator AMF on Friday rejected luxury group's LVMH's ( LVMH.PA ) call for the dismissal of the judicial procedure surrounding the investigation into the build-up of its first 17 percent stake in rival Hermes ( HRMS.PA ). 
 "The AMF panel rejects all the arguments presented by the defence <of LVMH>," said a panel spokeswoman. The AMF's full sanctions committee said it would formally respond to LVMH's request to have the procedure dismissed later on Friday.
