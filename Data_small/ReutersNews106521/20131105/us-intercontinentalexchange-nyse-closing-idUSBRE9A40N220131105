 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - IntercontinentalExchange Inc ( ICE.N ) Chief Executive Jeff Sprecher said on Tuesday that he hopes ICE's more than $10 billion NYSE Euronext NYX.N takeover will close within days. 
 The deal had been expected to close on November 4, but ICE on Wednesday postponed the closing to give more time for European regulators to approve the transaction. (Reporting by  John McCrank )
