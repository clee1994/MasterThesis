 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Vanguard Group Chief Executive William McNabb on Tuesday said the No. 1 U.S. mutual fund company had accumulated $40 billion in net assets during the first half of the year from the funds that switched away from benchmarks provided by MSCI Inc ( MSCI.N ). 
 "If you take those 22 funds, $40 billion has been accumulated during the first half of 2013," McNabb told Reuters. "We think people are accepting the change. It hasn't been the drag that a lot of people predicted it would be." He also said the net new assets from the funds that made the benchmark switch accounted for a slightly higher percentage of cash flows from the year-ago period. Vanguard announced the benchmark switch last October as other managers of index funds, such as BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ), moved to cut costs. News that one of its biggest index licensing customers had defected caused shares of MSCI to plunge. (Reporting by  Tim McLaughlin , editing by G Crosse)
