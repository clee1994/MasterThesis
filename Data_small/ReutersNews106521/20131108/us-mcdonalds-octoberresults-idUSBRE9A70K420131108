 (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) reported lower-than-expected comparable-restaurant sales for October as sales fell in Japan. 
 Global sales at restaurants open for more than a year rose 0.5 percent in October, but the growth was below the average analyst estimate of 0.6 percent, according to nine analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Comparable-restaurant sales in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa fell 2.8 percent in October mainly due to negative results in Japan, the world's largest burger chain said.
