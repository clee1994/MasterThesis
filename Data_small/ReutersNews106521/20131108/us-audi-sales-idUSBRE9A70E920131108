 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany's Audi ( VOWG_p.DE ) said sales in October increased 6.7 percent compared to the same month a year earlier to 131,950 luxury cars and sport-utility vehicles on demand for the compact A3 and Q3 models. 
 Ten-month deliveries were up 7.5 percent to 1.31 million vehicles, the Volkswagen-owned ( VOWG_p.DE ) division said on Friday, citing double-digit growth in the United States and China. By comparison, Daimler's ( DAIGn.DE ) Mercedes-Benz, which dropped to third place behind Audi in 2011 in global luxury-sales charts, earlier this week reported a new record in October deliveries. Mercedes sold 126,421 cars last month, a 15.3 percent gain, thanks to demand for its new E-Class. Luxury-market leader BMW ( BMWG.DE ) is expected to publish monthly deliveries next week.
