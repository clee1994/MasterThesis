 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ketchup maker Heinz Co HNZ.N said on Monday it has received all regulatory approvals needed to sell itself to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) and Brazilian financier Jorge Paulo Lemann's private equity firm 3G Capital. 
 In February, Buffett and Lemann revealed their plan to team up to buy Heinz for $23.2 billion. The deal was approved by Heinz shareholders on April 30. The companies expect the deal to close on or about June 7, Heinz said in a statement. (Reporting by  Dhanya Skariachan ; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
