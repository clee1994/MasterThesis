 (Reuters) - Prudential Financial ( PRU.N ) said on Monday it had received notice that U.S. regulators proposed declaring the firm is "systemically important," a designation that would bring stricter oversight. 
 Prudential said in a statement that it was considering whether to contest the proposed designation by requesting a hearing before the Financial Stability Oversight Council. A final designation by the council, which is composed of the heads of financial regulatory agencies, would bring the firm under regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve.
