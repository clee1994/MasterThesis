 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Wednesday that he would prefer to avoid long drawn-out negotiations on forming a new German government, in part because of outstanding European issues like banking union that need to be resolved quickly. 
 "I would prefer a quick deal to a slow one, given some important European policy decisions we are faced with, for example on banking union," Schaeuble told Die Zeit weekly in an interview. (Reporting by  Noah Barkin )
