 MILAN  (Reuters) - Shares in Italian lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena ( BMPS.MI ) opened lower on Wedensday after the bank's board delayed approval of a new restructuring plan aimed at winning a greenlight from the European Union for a state bailout. 
 In a statement late on Tuesday, the bank cited procedural reasons for the delay, but a source close to the situation told Reuters there was an "issue of substance" which was still being discussed with EU authorities. By 0709 GMT, the stock was down 1 percent at 0.21 euros, underperforming the European banking index .SX7P which was down 0.3 percent. (Reporting by  Silvia Aloisi )
