 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's foreign investment policy will remain stable and transparent as the country pushes through its reform agenda, the commerce ministry said on Tuesday. 
 Spokesman Shen Danyang also told a regular briefing that the ministry would implement decisions from the recent Communist Party reform meeting in a timely manner. He did not elaborate. He reiterated the ministry's view that the outlook for China's exporters was uncertain, adding that exporters were under pressure from a rising yuan.
