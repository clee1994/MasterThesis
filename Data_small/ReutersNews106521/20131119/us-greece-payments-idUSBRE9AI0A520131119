 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's current account surplus widened in September, the Bank of Greece said on Tuesday, helped by a rise in tourism receipts. 
 The current account balance, a key measure of economic competitiveness, showed a surplus of 964 million euros ($1.30 billion) from 895 million euros in the same month last year. Tourism receipts, the country's biggest money earner, rose 17.3 percent year-on-year to 2.07 billion euros in September, bringing total revenue in the first nine months of the year to 10.7 billion euros, up 14.3 percent year-on-year.
