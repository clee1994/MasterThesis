 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - European Central Bank policy will remain accommodative for as long as needed, ECB President Mario Draghi said, signaling a readiness to keep interest rates low for months to come to aid an economic recovery. 
 Earlier on Thursday, the ECB held its main interest rate at a record low of 0.50 percent. It also left the rate on its deposit facility at 0.0 percent and held its marginal lending facility - or emergency borrowing rate - at 1.00 percent. "The accommodative stance of our monetary policy ... should continue to support prospects of an economic recovery later in the year," Draghi told a news conference after the rate decision.
