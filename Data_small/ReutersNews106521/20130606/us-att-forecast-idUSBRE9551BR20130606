 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc ( T.N ) said on Thursday that it expects to report second quarter net subscriber additions of about 500,000 and stronger U-verse broadband and TV subscriber growth. 
 It backed its full year forecast for revenue growth exceeding 2 percent and reported "strong free cash flow" and another $1 billion in cash proceeds. It said that the cash came from a distribution of about $500 million from YP Holdings LLC, where AT&T holds a minority stake, and about $550 million from its recent sale of shares in America Movil ( AMXL.MX ) shares.
