 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Senate Banking Committee on Thursday voted 20-2 in favor of the nomination of Fred Hochberg to serve a second term as president of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which provides financial assistance to support U.S. exports. 
 "Today's bipartisan vote is a testament to Fred's dedication and record of success, and I hope the Senate will move quickly to confirm him for another term," Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat, said in a statement. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer ; Editing by  Sandra Maler )
