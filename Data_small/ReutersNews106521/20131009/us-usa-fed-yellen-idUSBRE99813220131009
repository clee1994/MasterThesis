 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen said on Wednesday she would do her utmost to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and a strong and stable financial system if she is confirmed by the U.S. Senate to run the central bank. 
 Yellen said the United States has made progress in recovering from the financial crisis, but has further to go. "Too many Americans still can't find a job and worry how they'll pay their bills and provide for their families. The Federal Reserve can help if it does its job effectively," Yellen said at the White House. (Reporting by  Jeff Mason ,  Roberta Rampton ; Editing by  Sandra Maler )
