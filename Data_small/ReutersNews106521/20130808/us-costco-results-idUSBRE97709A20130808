 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) reported July same-store sales that missed analysts' estimates, hurt by a stronger dollar that pulled in weak sales from its overseas stores. 
 Sales at stores open at least a year rose 4 percent in the four-week period ended August 4, including the impact of fuel and foreign exchange. On that basis, analysts expected same-store sales to rise 5.1 percent for the month of July, according to Thomson Reuters data. Foreign exchange had a negative impact on comparable sales, the company said in a statement. Costco, which competes with BJ's Wholesale Club Inc BJ.UL and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's ( WMT.N ) Sam's Club, offers everyday items like bananas below supermarket prices, hoping customers will buy other goods as well and usually prices gasoline lower than competing stations. July net sales rose 7 percent to $7.87 billion. (Reporting by Vijay Vishwas in Bangalore; Editing by David Cowell)
