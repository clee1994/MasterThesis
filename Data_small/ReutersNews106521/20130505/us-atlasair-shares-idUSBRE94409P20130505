 (Reuters) - Shares of global air-freight operator Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings ( AAWW.O ) are undervalued and now is a good time for investors to get on board, financial newspaper Barron's said on Sunday. 
 Atlas' price was recently around $42 a share, trading at eight times 2014 earnings estimates, versus its historic range of 12 to 15 times. As a result, some investors and analysts think the stock could climb nearly 50 percent to $60, the article said. Stronger-than-expected first quarter earnings last week, along with bright earnings prospects on the back of demand for its new fleet of fuel-efficient Boeing ( BA.N ) 747-8 air freighters and a pickup in global volume, are positives for the company's stock, Barron's said.
