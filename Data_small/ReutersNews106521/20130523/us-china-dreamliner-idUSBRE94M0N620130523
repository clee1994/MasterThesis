 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's civil aviation regulator on Thursday formally approved Boeing Co's ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliner for use in the country, clearing the way for Chinese airlines to start operating the aircraft, which has been plagued with problems. 
 The regulator made the announcement in a short statement on its website (www.caac.gov.cn), without giving further details. China Southern Airlines Co Ltd ( 1055.HK ) ( 600029.SS ) ( ZNH.N ) and smaller rival Hainan Airlines ( 600221.SS ) are among the global carriers which have ordered the aircraft. The 787 Dreamliner was grounded worldwide in January after batteries overheated on jets owned by ANA Holdings Inc ( 9202.T ) and Japan Airlines Co Ltd ( 9201.T ). Investigators in the United States and Japan have yet to establish what caused the batteries to overheat. (Reporting by  Ben Blanchard ; editing by  Jason Neely )
