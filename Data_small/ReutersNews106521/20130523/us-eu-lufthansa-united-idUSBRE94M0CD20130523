 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators accepted on Thursday concessions from Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ), United Airlines ( UAL.N ), Air Canada ( ACb.TO ) and Continental to ease competition concerns about their transatlantic revenue-sharing pact. 
 The European Commission said the airlines would give up airport slots in Frankfurt and New York, and also allow rivals to sell tickets on this route, confirming a Reuters story in February. "This decision is a further milestone in our effort to create a level playing field on transatlantic aviation markets, following our decision on oneworld in 2010," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.
