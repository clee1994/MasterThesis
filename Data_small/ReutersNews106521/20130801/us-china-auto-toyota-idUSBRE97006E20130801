 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) and its two local joint-venture partners sold about 75,600 automobiles in China in July, down 3.5 percent from a year earlier, the Japanese automaker said on Thursday. 
 That follows a 9 percent year-on-year increase in June and a 0.3 percent climb in May. In the first seven months of this year, through the end of July, Toyota sold a total of about 492,500 vehicles, down 5.4 percent from a year earlier. Toyota, which operates joint ventures in China with FAW Group ( 000800.SZ ) and Guangzhou Automobile Group ( 601238.SS ), is aiming to sell 900,000 vehicles in China this year, up 7.1 percent from 2012.
