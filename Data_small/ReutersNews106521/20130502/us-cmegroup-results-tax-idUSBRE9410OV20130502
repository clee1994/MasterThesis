 (Reuters) - Proposed U.S. tax increases on futures trading would hurt liquidity and are ultimately unlikely to become law, CME Group Inc ( CME.O ) Executive Chairman Terrence predicted on Thursday. 
 "I believe that most people on the Hill understand that this would be a detrimental tax," Duffy said of recent U.S. budget proposals to eliminate favorable tax treatment for individual market makers in futures, and to impose a transaction tax on trading. "I do think that will not prevail," Duffy told analysts on a conference call to discuss first-quarter earnings. CME Group is the world's largest operator of futures markets.
