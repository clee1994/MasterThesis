 BRATISLAVA  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's decision makers were split over whether to cut or hold interest rates, its head, Mario Draghi, implied on Thursday. 
 "There was a very, very strong consensus towards an interest rate cut," Draghi told a news conference. The ECB uses the term consensus when a decision is not unanimous. He said that within that consensus there was a prevailing consensus towards 25 basis points. (Reporting by Michael Shields Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)
