Thursday's dinner comes ahead of Friday's release of unemployment data for April. Topics for discussion might also touch on the global economy, including Europe and China, and cyber security. According to a Treasury official, attendants will also include: Leon Black of Apollo Management LP APOLO.UL; Mark Gallogly of Centerbridge Partners; Stephen Freidheim of Cyrus Capital Partners; Ralph Schlosstein of Evercore Partners Inc ( EVR.N ); Terry Lundgren of Macy's Inc ( M.N ); Daniel Glaser of Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc ( MMC.N ); Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ); Frank Brosens of Taconic Capital Advisors and Robert Greifeld of the NASDAQ OMX Group Inc ( NDAQ.O ).
