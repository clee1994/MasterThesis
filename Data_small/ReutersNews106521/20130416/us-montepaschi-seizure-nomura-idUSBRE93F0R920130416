 LONDON  (Reuters) - Japan's Nomura ( 8604.T ) rejected accusations of wrongdoing by prosecutors in the Italian city of Siena as part of a probe into deals the bank set up for Monte dei Paschi ( BMPS.MI ). 
 Italian prosecutors have ordered the seizure of 1.8 billion euros ($2.4 billion) of assets from Nomura as part of investigations into suspected fraud at troubled lender MPS. "No Nomura assets have been seized," the bank said in a statement. "We will take all appropriate steps to protect our position and will vigorously contest any suggestions of wrongdoing in this matter." (Reporting by  Steve Slater ; Editing by Matt Scuffham)
