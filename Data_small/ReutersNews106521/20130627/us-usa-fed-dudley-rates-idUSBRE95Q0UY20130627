 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ben Bernanke was "very clear" last week when the Federal Reserve chairman explained how the U.S. central bank plans to reduce accommodation, and he did not intend to send a "signal to the market," New York Fed President William Dudley said on Thursday. 
 While the resulting rise in longer-term rates and tighter financial-market conditions can hurt the U.S. economic recovery, Dudley added, incoming economic data are more important as the Fed decides how to adjust its policies. (Reporting by  Jonathan Spicer ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
