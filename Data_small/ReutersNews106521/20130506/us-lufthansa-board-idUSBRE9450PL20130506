 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German airline Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) said on Monday it would nominate its former chief executive Wolfgang Mayrhuber to join the company's supervisory board. 
 Earlier, the airline had announced that Mayrhuber had withdrawn as a candidate to join the board as chairman amid signs of shareholder opposition. (Reporting By Marilyn Gerlach; Editing by  Noah Barkin )
