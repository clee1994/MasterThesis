The European Banking Authority (EBA) will finalize draft rules for a common definition of non-performing loans (NPL) and refer the draft to national supervisors. The definition could force banks to recategorize some loans as NPLs, which would affect their capital ratios. OCTOBER 2013 The ECB will ramp up efforts to hire at least 1,000 experts to work for the Single Supervisory Mechanism in Frankfurt, of which around 750 will be involved in supervision. The ECB will publish a vacancy notice for the chair of the SSM supervisory board, followed by those for top management, and middle management a few weeks later.
