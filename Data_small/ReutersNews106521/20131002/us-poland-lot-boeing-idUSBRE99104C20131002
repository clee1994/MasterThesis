 WARSAW  (Reuters) - Poland is determined to get compensation from Boeing ( BA.N ) for the glitches haunting its 787 Dreamliner jets which are used by the country's state-controlled carrier LOT LOT.UL, its treasury minister said on Wednesday. 
 "When it comes to Dreamliners I would say it's a rather nervous dream," Wlodzimierz Karpinski told Polish public radio in an interview. "I'm angry. There are problems not only for the Polish airlines. I want to ensure that we will seek compensation from the producer with full determination." LOT has already said it was demanding compensation for lost revenue linked to a number of Dreamliner problems and has given Boeing until the end of the year to settle over faults or face court action.
