 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq, Nasdaq BX and Nasdaq PSX said on Thursday they have revoked "self-help" against the BATS stock exchange. 
 Self-help means an exchange is dealing with internal problems processing trades and needs to send trades through other venues. (Reporting by  Caroline Valetkevitch )
