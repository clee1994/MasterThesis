 WASHINGTON (Reuters)- Consumer credit increased in April but a modest increase in a measure of credit card usage suggested households are still working on reducing their debt load, which could hobble consumer spending growth. 
 Total consumer installment credit advanced by $11.1 billion to $2.8 trillion, Federal Reserve data showed on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected consumer credit to rise $12 billion in April. Revolving credit, which mostly measures credit-card use, rebounded $682.3 million, failing to recoup March's $906.4 million decline. Nonrevolving credit, which includes auto loans as well as student loans made by the government, increased $10.4 billion in April. That followed a $9.3 billion increase in March. Analysts say credit growth is being mainly driven by student loans. (Reporting by  Lucia Mutikani ; Editing by  Andrea Ricci )
