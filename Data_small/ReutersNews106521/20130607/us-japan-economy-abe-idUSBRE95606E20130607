 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declined to comment on market movements on Friday after the yen marked its biggest one-day climb against the dollar in three years the day before. 
 "I don't want to comment on market movements," said Abe, speaking during a joint news conference with French President Francois Hollande, who is on a three-day visit in Tokyo. Stock and currency markets in recent days have taken some wind out of "Abenomics," a policy prescription of sweeping fiscal and monetary expansion aimed at breaking years of deflation and reviving the world's third-biggest economy <FRX/>.
