 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - Central banks should tackle financial imbalances even if it means sacrificing some economic growth, the Reserve Bank of India deputy governor Anand Sinha said in a speech on Wednesday. 
 India's central bank has recently unveiled a slew of measures including draining cash and raising short-term interest rates, sparking concerns about the impact on economic growth. Sinha Also said macroprudential regulations and monetary policy should move in the same direction. (Reporting by Shamik Paul; Writing by  Subhadip Sircar ; Editing by  Rafael Nam )
