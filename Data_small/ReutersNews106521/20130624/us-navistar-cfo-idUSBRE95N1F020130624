 (Reuters) - Navistar International Corp ( NAV.N ) said Chief Financial Officer Andrew Cederoth would leave the company by the end of June, the latest management change at the truck and engine maker looking to recover from a disastrous engine redesign. 
 Navistar said Treasurer James Moran will take over until the company appoints a permanent replacement for Cederoth. Cederoth was the CFO of Navistar since September 2009 and the company said his resignation was part of a planned transition to a new CFO. "It is likely the new leaders/board are looking for a clean slate from which to drive change and improvement in the business model," Robert W. Baird & Co analyst David Leiker said. "We have no reason to believe this departure is related to the weak stock performance in recent weeks." Navistar ousted its long-term Chief Executive Daniel Ustian in August after a new diesel engine technology failed to win regulatory approval, forcing the company to temporarily source engines from rival Cummins Inc ( CMI.N ). The company named former Chief Operating Officer Troy Clarke CEO in March, after a brief stint by turnaround specialist Lewis Campbell, a former Textron Inc ( TXT.N ) chief. Navistar's turnaround plan received another jolt after it reported a bigger second-quarter loss earlier this month as it continued to book higher warranty costs and lost sales while moving to a new engine technology. This was the company's sixth quarterly loss in a row. Lisle, Illinois-based Navistar's shares fell 2.4 percent in extended trading after closing at $26.62 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. The stock has fallen about 22 percent since the latest results. (Reporting by Mridhula Raghavan and Anil D'Silva in Bangalore; Editing by Joyjeet Das)
