 (Reuters) - Navistar International Corp ( NAV.N ) on Monday said Chief Financial Officer Andrew Cederoth will resign by the end of June, the latest management change at the truck and engine maker that is looking to recover from a disastrous engine redesign. 
 Navistar said Treasurer James Moran will take over until the company appoints a permanent replacement for Cederoth. Cederoth was the CFO of Navistar since September 2009 and the company said his resignation was part of a planned transition to a new CFO. Navistar ousted its long-term chief executive Daniel Ustian in August after a new diesel engine technology failed to win regulatory approval, forcing the company to temporarily source engines from rival Cummins Inc ( CMI.N ). The company named former Chief Operating Officer Troy Clarke as chief executive in March, after a brief stint by turnaround specialist Lewis Campbell, a former Textron Inc ( TXT.N ) chief. Navistar shares fell 2.4 percent in extended trading after closing at $26.62 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. (Reporting by Mridhula Raghavan in Bangalore; Editing by Joyjeet Das)
