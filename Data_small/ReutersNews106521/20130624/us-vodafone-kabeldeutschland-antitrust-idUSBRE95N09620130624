 DUESSELDORF, Germany  (Reuters) - Germany's antitrust regulator said it would likely be responsible for examining the proposed takeover of Kabel Deutschland by Vodafone. 
 A Kabel Deutschland-Vodafone deal, which has not yet been filed for approval, would in theory be a matter for the national watchdog, a spokesman for Germany's Federal Cartel Office said. The European Commission, which is the antitrust regulator for cross-boarder competition in the region, is likely to refer the case to the Federal Cartel Office because the deal would mainly affect the German market, the spokesman said.
