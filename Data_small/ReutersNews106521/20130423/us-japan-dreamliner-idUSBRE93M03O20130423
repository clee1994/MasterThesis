 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Civil Aviation Authority said final permission to resume Boeing Co's grounded Dreamliner flights may come as early as Thursday. 
 Boeing engineers on Monday began installing reinforced lithium-ion battery systems on the Boeing 787 jets in Japan, starting with launch customer All Nippon Airways. That should make the first 787 ready to restart flights in about a week. (Reporting by Tim Kelly; Editing by  Ken Wills )
