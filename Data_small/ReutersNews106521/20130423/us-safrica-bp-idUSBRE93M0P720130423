 JOHANNESBURG  (Reuters) - British oil company BP ( BP.L ) intends to invest nearly 5 billion rand ($539 million) in South Africa over the next five years, half of which will be spent to upgrade a joint-venture refinery it owns with Shell called Sapref. 
 The upgrade will primarily be to comply with South Africa's proposed clean fuels requirements, group managing director Iain Conn said in a statement on Tuesday. Some of the money will also go to opening 120 new convenience stores at fuel stations in partnership with South African retailer Pick n Pay ( PIKJ.J ). The company said it would also be investing in neighboring Mozambique. (Reporting by  Helen Nyambura-Mwaura ; Editing by  Jon Herskovitz )
