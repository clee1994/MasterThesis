 LONDON  (Reuters) - Bankers working on the sale of the bulk of Vivendi's ( VIV.PA ) stake in Activision Blizzard Inc ( ATVI.O ) to the video games maker and its management could earn advisory fees of up to $80 million, according to an industry estimate. 
 France's Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) announced the $8.2 billion sale on Friday, its second blockbuster deal in a week. Bankers in the telecoms, media and technology sector are expecting fees from a flurry of deals, unlike their peers in other sectors where activity is subdued. On Tuesday, Vivendi said it was in exclusive talks to sell its controlling stake in Maroc Telecom ( IAM.CS ) for 4.2 billion euros ($5.6 billion) to Etisalat ETEL.AD. And Dutch telecoms group KPN ( KPN.AS ) announced the sale of its German business E-Plus for 8.1 billion euros to Spain's Telefonica ( TEF.MC ) on the same day. In the media and entertainment sector, global deal activity is up 32 percent with 1,380 transactions worth $84 billion so far this year, Thomson Reuters data at July 25 showed. Activity in the telecommunications sector is up 36 percent, with 358 deals worth $60.9 billion. But M&A activity overall is down 12 percent, with 19,388 deals worth $1,170 billion. This has resulted in a 16 percent drop in fees in the first half of the year. Vivendi hired Barclays ( BARC.L ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) to advise it on the Activision deal and those banks could potentially share a fee pot of $35 million to $45 million, Freeman Consulting, which tracks bankers' fees, estimated. Activision hired JPMorgan ( JPM.N ), which is set to receive $25 million to $35 million. Centerview advised Activision's independent directors. On the sale of its stake in Maroc Telecom, Vivendi is being advised by Credit Agricole CRAGO.UL and Lazard ( LAZ.N ) and Etisalat by BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) and Attijariwafabank. Credit Agricole and Lazard will share between $27 million and $35 million for their work on the deal, while BNP Paribas is set to earn $20 million to $30 million. Banks working on the Sale of KPN's German business to Telefonica were looking at a fee pot of up to $75 million, Freeman estimated. (Editing by Erica Billingham and  David Holmes )
