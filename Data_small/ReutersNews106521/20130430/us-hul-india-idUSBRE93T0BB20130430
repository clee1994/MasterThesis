 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever Plc does not intend to increase its stake in Indian arm Hindustan Unilever beyond 75 percent, James Allison, head of investor relations and M&A, told Indian television channel CNBC-TV 18 on Tuesday. 
 Earlier in the day Unilever offered to pay as much as $5.4 billion to raise its stake in its Indian unit, banking on fast-growing spending power in Asia's third-largest economy. (Reporting by Nandita Bose; Editing by Jijo Jacob)
