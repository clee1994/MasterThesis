 (Reuters) - A plunge in Symantec shares on Tuesday was the result of a large sell order that did not specify a limit on the price the investor was willing to sell, a company spokesman said. 
 Shares of Symantec dropped 10 percent, from $24.40 to a low of $21.93, before it was halted on the Nasdaq, as 500,000-plus shares changed hands in a three-second period. Trading resumed shortly thereafter, with the stock now trading at $24.26. (Reporting By  Jim Finkle  in Boston; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
