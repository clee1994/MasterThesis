 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's Thomson Airways said on Saturday that it had replaced a small number of components on a Boeing Dreamliner that had to turn back during a flight on Friday and the aircraft had been fully tested and would fly again on Sunday morning. 
 A spokeswoman for the airline said the aircraft, which had turned back as a precautionary measure during a flight from Manchester in northwest England to Sanford in Florida, had suffered a "minor technical issue". The plane will depart Manchester for Cancun at 0950am (8:50 a.m. GMT / 4:50 a.m. EDT) and Thomson's two other Dreamliners have also been fully tested and will fly from London's Gatwick airport to Sanford and to Palma on Sunday morning, the airline said.
