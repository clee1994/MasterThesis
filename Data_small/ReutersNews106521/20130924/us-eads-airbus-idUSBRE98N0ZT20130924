 PARIS  (Reuters) - Airbus ( EAD.PA ) will launch a short-range "Regional" version of its best-selling A330 wide-bodied jet at an airshow in China on Wednesday, industry sources said. 
 The announcement could come with a new order from China for the aircraft which will be adapted for shorter and more frequent trips than the current long-distance version. Airbus declined to comment. (Reporting by  Tim Hepher , editing by Ingrid Melander)
