 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence slid in September as consumers' outlook for the future slipped, according to a private sector report released on Tuesday. 
 The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 79.7 from a revised 81.8 in August, compared to economists' expectations for 79.9. The expectations index fell to 84.1 from an upwardly revised 89.0 in August. Consumers, however, were a little more optimistic about their current standing, with the present situation index rising to 73.2 from a revised 70.9 in August.
