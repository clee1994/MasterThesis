 BONN, Germany  (Reuters) - A takeover of Kabel Deutschland ( KD8Gn.DE ) by peer Liberty Global ( LBTYA.O ) would be more complicated from an anti-trust point of view than an acquisition by Vodafone ( VOD.L ), Germany's cartel office said on Wednesday. 
 Vodafone on Monday agreed to buy Germany's largest cable operator Kabel Deutschland for 7.7 billion euros ($10.1 billion), beating Liberty Global, which could still return with a higher bid. Liberty Global owns Germany's second-largest cable operator Unity Media KabelBW. ($1 = 0.7649 euros) (Reporting by Tom Kaeckenhoff; Writing by Harro ten Wolde; Editing by  Christoph Steitz )
