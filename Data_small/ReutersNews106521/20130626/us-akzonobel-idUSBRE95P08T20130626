 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch paints and chemicals group AkzoNobel NV ( AKZO.AS ) said on Wednesday it plans to sell its 72 decorative paints stores for professionals in Germany to independent wholesale distributors to improve efficiency. 
 "The new set-up will allow AkzoNobel to select the most efficient distribution channels for its professional paint products, rather than operating its own stores," the company said in a statement, adding that it wants to enter into strategic partnership agreements with the future shop owners. No financial details were given. (Reporting by  Sara Webb ; Editing by  Mark Potter )
