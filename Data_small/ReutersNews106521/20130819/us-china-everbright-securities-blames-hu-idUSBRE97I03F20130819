 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Everbright Securities ( 601788.SS ), the Chinese brokerage caught up in mistaken trades on Friday and again this week, said human error was responsible for a mistaken bond trade on Monday morning. 
 Monday's mistake occurred on a trade with a face value of 10 million yuan ($1.64 million) of government bonds. A trader mistakenly inputted a yield of 4.20 percent, 25 basis points higher than the yield on the same bond at Friday's close, the brokerage said in a statement on its website on Monday afternoon. The Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission blamed a trading system error for mistaken stock trades that occurred on Friday.
