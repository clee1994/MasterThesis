 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Co ( GM.N ) has hired a top Delphi Automotive Plc ( DLPH.N ) executive to lead the largest U.S. automaker's global powertrain operations beginning next month, GM announced on Monday. 
 Steve Kiefer, who has led Delphi's powertrain systems unit since 2011, fills a position that has been left vacant for more than two years. He will start at GM on September 1. His hiring comes as GM tries to lop off about $1 billion a year in product development costs and boost its margins to better compete with U.S. rival Ford Motor Co ( F.N ). Kiefer, 50, will report to Mary Barra, head of GM's global product development unit, and will be based at GM's powertrain headquarters in Pontiac. (Reporting by Deepa Seetharaman.
