 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's central bank announced long-awaited interest rate reforms on Friday, scrapping the floor on rates that banks charge clients for loans. 
 The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its website that rate reform will help lower financial costs for companies. ** Says to remove controls over bill discount rates. ** It did not remove a cap on deposit rates. ** The new rules come into effect on Saturday. ** Continues differentiated lending policies for housing. ** Australian dollar rises on news. COMMENTARY JOE NEIGHBOUR, SENIOR BROKER, CENTRAL MARKETS, LONDON: "It's another method of easing and a form of looser monetary policy." MARK WILLIAMS, CHIEF ASIA ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS: "It's a very big deal, probably more in terms of what it symbolizes than the effect on the economy. China has been talking about interest rate liberalization for a long time, this is one of the biggest steps they could have taken. "It does not necessarily change very much today, but it tells you something about the trajectory. Only a very small proportion of loans will be affected by this decision. "Before today, banks were allowed to lend at no more than a 30 percent discount to the benchmark rate, but only 11 percent of loans were offered at any discount."
