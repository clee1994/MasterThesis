 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A measure of future U.S. economic growth dipped last week, while the annualized growth rate also pulled back, a research group said on Friday. 
 The Economic Cycle Research Institute, a New York-based independent forecasting group, said its Weekly Leading Index fell to 130.2 in the week ended May 10 from 131.0 the previous week. The index's annualized growth rate slipped to 7.0 percent from 7.4 percent a week earlier. (Reporting by  Leah Schnurr ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
