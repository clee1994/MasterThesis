 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ) and China-based Mining Machinery Ltd said on Thursday they have settled outstanding issues related to Caterpillar's acquisition of mining equipment firm ERA and its Siwei unit through a reduction in the purchase price. 
 As part of the deal announced on Thursday, Caterpillar's outstanding payment obligations to Mining Machinery were reduced by $135 million to $29.5 million. Caterpillar reported in January that it had found "deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct" at Siwei. The world's largest maker of construction equipment had acquired ERA for $653.4 million (HK$5.06 billion) from Mining Machinery last June. Siwei is China's fourth-largest maker of hydraulic roof supports. (Reporting by Pallavi Ail in Bangalore; Editing by Stephen Coates)
