 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Management consulting firm Accenture Plc ( ACN.N ) is in talks to acquire rival Booz & Co, a deal that would beef up its strategy and operations consulting services, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. 
 Acquisition-hungry Accenture has this year announced it would be acquiring London-based global service design consultancy Fjord and digital marketing company Acquity Group as well as Mortgage Cadence, a loan origination software company. Representatives for Accenture were not available for comment after normal business hours. A spokeswoman for Booz & Co said the firm does not address market or media speculation pertaining to it. Accenture has about 266,000 employees worldwide and net revenues of $27.9 billion for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2012, the company's website said. Booz & Co has over 3,000 employees globally, according to information on the company's website. It ended discussions of a possible merger with A.T. Kearney, another management consulting firm, in July 2010. Accenture cut its full-year outlook last month, citing a pullback in spending by its consulting business clients, after reporting third-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates.
