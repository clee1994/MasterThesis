 (Reuters) - Mobileye N.V., whose collision-avoidance technology has been adopted in cars made by the likes of BMW AG ( BMWG.DE ) and General Motors Co ( GM.N ), said on Sunday it had raised money from five investors that valued its equity at $1.5 billion, highlighting the market potential for driver-assistance systems. 
 Founded in 1999 by an Israeli businessman and a professor of computer science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mobileye sold its 1 millionth driver assistance system last year. It has said it expects to sell 2 million more in 2013. The Amsterdam-based company said the five equity investments totaled about $400 million. The figures provided by the company imply that the five investors collectively acquired roughly a 27 percent stake in Mobileye. Mobileye did not name the buyers and sellers of the equity, but said some of the largest U.S.-based global institutional asset managers and a leading Chinese government-affiliated financial investor were among the investors who bought into the company. A person familiar with the matter disclosed the names of these five new investors on condition of anonymity because their identities have been kept confidential. They are BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ), Fidelity Investments, Wellington Management Co, car rental company Enterprise Holdings Inc and China's Sailing Capital Management, the person said. Mobileye's collision-warning systems, sold to suppliers and automakers for a little more than $100 each, are an option for customers in car brands including Volvo AB ( VOLVb.ST ), Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) and Hyundai Corp ( 011760.KS ). Starting in 2014, Mobileye's products will be a standard feature on many cars because of new regulations that will require driver-assistance systems for cars to receive five-star safety ratings. Mobileye's systems include a camera mounted on the windshield that takes pictures of what is in front of the driver. A chip, manufactured by STMicroelectronics ( STM.PA ), processes the images and in real-time issues audio-visual warnings to drivers on a small device on the dashboard. Among the warnings are those for collision if another car is too close and if the car is in danger of hitting a pedestrian. The system automatically brakes before impact. The transaction, in which Goldman Sachs & Co ( GS.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) served as the placement agents, is expected to close in August, Mobileye said.
