 MIRABEL, Quebec  (Reuters) - Bombardier Inc's ( BBDb.TO ) new CSeries jetliner landed successfully Monday, ending the first flight in the company's$3.4 billion program to develop a new narrow-bodied plane. 
 The CSeries touched down at 12:23 p.m. EDT at an airfield beside Bombardier's factory, about 2-1/2 hours after taking off. With the new jet, the Montreal-based plane and train maker is attempting to break into the hyper-competitive larger aircraft segment currently dominated by Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and Airbus ( EAD.PA ).
