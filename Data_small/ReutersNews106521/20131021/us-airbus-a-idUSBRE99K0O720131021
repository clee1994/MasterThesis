 TOULOUSE, France  (Reuters) - Flight trials for Airbus's latest passenger jet, the A350, are going well and the European planemaker is sticking to its target of delivering the first of the lightweight jets in the second half of 2014, program chief Didier Evrard said. 
 "The flight test program... is going very well," Evrard told reporters at a briefing on Monday, adding that the project was approaching its "most critical phase" as it enters the industrial ramp-up. (Reporting by Cyril Altmeyer; Writing by  Tim Hepher ; Editing by  James Regan )
