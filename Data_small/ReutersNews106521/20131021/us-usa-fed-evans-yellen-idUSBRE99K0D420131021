 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Janet Yellen will ensure monetary policy "continuity" once she replaces Ben Bernanke as chair of the Federal Reserve next year, a senior U.S. central banker said on Monday. 
 "I think Janet will be a great chairman. She has an awful lot of experience with monetary policy - up close and personal," Chicago Federal reserve President Charles Evans told CNBC television in an interview. "I think we'll see a lot of continuity. And we'll be looking at the economic situation and inflationary pressures as they present themselves, and (will) respond accordingly," he said.
