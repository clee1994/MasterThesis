 (Reuters) - Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc ( MSO.N ) and J.C. Penney Co Inc ( JCP.N ) said on Monday that Penney will no longer be represented on Martha Stewart's board under a revised commercial agreement covering their licensing and design partnership. 
 The amended agreement also covers a more focused range of categories over a shorter period of time ending on June 30, 2017, the companies said. It was not immediately clear how, if at all, the revised agreement could affect a major lawsuit the companies face. Macy's Inc ( M.N ), which had an exclusive deal with Martha Stewart, sued Penney and Martha Stewart Living last year over a partnership announced in 2011 in which Penney would open Martha Stewart home shops at hundreds of stores.
