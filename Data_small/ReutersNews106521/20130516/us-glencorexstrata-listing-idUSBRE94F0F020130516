 ZUG, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Miner and trader Glencore Xstrata ( GLEN.L ) said on Thursday it was considering listing on the Swiss stock exchange, in addition to its existing listings in London and Hong Kong. 
 In answer to a shareholder question at the group's annual general meeting about a Swiss listing, Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg said the company was "investigating that". Switzerland-based Glencore made its market debut in 2011 and is now the world's fourth-largest diversified miner, following the acquisition of Xstrata. Media reports have also said it has been considering a listing in Johannesburg. (Reporting by  Emma Farge ; Editing by Greg Mahlich)
