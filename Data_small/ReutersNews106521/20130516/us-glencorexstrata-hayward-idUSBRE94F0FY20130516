 LONDON  (Reuters) - Glencore Xstrata ( GLEN.L ) is set to appoint former BP boss Tony Hayward as interim chairman, after John Bond failed to be reelected to the top job at the company's inaugural shareholder meeting, a source with knowledge of the matter said. 
 Bond had been expected to step down following trader Glencore's takeover of miner Xstrata, but only once a replacement was found. Instead, he abruptly left after announcing to investors on Thursday that he had not been reelected. Hayward was already senior independent director, a role he took when Glencore listed in 2011. At the time, the move was seen as a comeback for the former chief executive of oil major BP, ousted from the role after the Deepwater Horizon disaster.
