 LONDON  (Reuters) - Former BP boss Tony Hayward, appointed as interim chairman of Glencore Xstrata ( GLEN.L ) on Thursday, will step down once a new chairman takes up the role, the company said. 
 Earlier, a source with knowledge of the matter said Hayward, Glencore's senior independent director before Thursday, would lead the nominations committee but would not throw his own hat in the ring. (Reporting by  Clara Ferreira-Marques ; Editing by  Sinead Cruise )
