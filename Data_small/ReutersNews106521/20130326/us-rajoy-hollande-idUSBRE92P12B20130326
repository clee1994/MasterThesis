 PARIS  (Reuters) - Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Tuesday said a European bailout for Cyprus which imposed losses for depositors was a unique and exceptional case which should not be replicated in other countries. 
 At a joint presser with French president Francois Hollande, Rajoy also said it was important to stick to the agreed calendar for the creation of a banking union in Europe. "This is an exceptional and unique case, which is being exceptionally applied to Cyprus," he told journalists. "Spain will defend that we agree in June on a system for a European recapitalization of banks and in December for a guarantee for deposits and a single resolution system."
