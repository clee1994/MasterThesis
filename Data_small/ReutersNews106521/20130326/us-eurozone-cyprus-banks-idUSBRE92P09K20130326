 LONDON  (Reuters) - Cypriot Finance Minister Michael Sarris said on Tuesday he thought that the country's banks would reopen on Thursday having been shut to prevent a run on deposits after an international bailout. 
 Asked if the banks would reopen on Thursday, he told BBC radio: "Yes I think they will. I think we needed some time to put together a balanced package of some restrictions." (Reporting by  Michael Holden ; editing by  Guy Faulconbridge )
