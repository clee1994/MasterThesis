 MUNICH  (Reuters) - German lighting maker Osram Licht AG ( OSRn.DE ) said it expects its net income to improve sharply in its current fiscal year after it cut jobs and shuttered factories to return to profit. 
 Osram, the world's No. 2 lighting maker after Philips ( PHG.AS ), is in the midst of a restructuring, having been slow to adjust to a shift in demand from traditional light bulbs to newer technologies such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs). It said on Tuesday it was now cutting an overall 8,700 jobs, or 21 percent of its workforce, to generate gross savings of 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion). So far, only two of Osram's remaining 36 factories make LEDs - in Regensburg, Germany and Penang, Malaysia - but it is building a new plant in China at a cost of over 100 million euros to boost its presence in the fast-growing Asian market. Meanwhile, newer players in lighting such as South Korea's Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ) and Japan's Toyoda Gosei ( 7282.T ) are grabbing market share from traditional industry leaders - Philips, Osram and General Electric ( GE.N ). In its year to the end of September, the company, spun off from Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) earlier this year, swung to a net profit of 34 million euros from a year-earlier loss of 391 million thanks to its restructuring program and a gain from the sale of a stake in a joint venture. That fell slightly short of analysts' consensus forecast of 38.2 million euros in a Reuters poll. <ID:L5N0IT2X7> ($1 = 0.7459 euros) (Reporting by  Maria Sheahan ; Editing by  Jonathan Gould )
