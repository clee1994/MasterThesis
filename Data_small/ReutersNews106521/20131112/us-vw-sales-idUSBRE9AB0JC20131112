 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German automaker Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) said sales of its core passenger-car brand rose 2 percent in October "despite ongoing economic uncertainty." 
 Deliveries at VW's namesake brand increased to 511,400 cars and sport-utility vehicles from 501,400 a year earlier, the Wolfsburg-based company said on Tuesday. Ten-month sales were up 3.4 percent at 4.88 million, with double-digit growth in China, VW's largest market, outweighing a 5.3-percent drop in Europe. Group sales including luxury division Audi and sports-car maker Porsche are expected to be released later this week. (Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by  Jonathan Gould )
