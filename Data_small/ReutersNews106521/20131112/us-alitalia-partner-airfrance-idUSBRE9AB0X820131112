 PARIS  (Reuters) - Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) considers Alitalia to have too much debt, and the likelihood of the Franco-Dutch airline taking part in a capital increase at the Italian carrier is "very low", a source close to the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. 
 Air France-KLM considers that an industrial plan for the loss-making airline including about 2,000 job cuts is a step in the right direction but sees Alitalia's target to break even in 2014 at the operating level as unrealistic, the source said on condition of anonymity.
