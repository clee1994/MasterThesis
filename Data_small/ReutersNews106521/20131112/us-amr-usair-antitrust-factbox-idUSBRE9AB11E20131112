 (Reuters) - US Airways Group Inc and American Airlines said on Tuesday they agreed to give up dozens of airport slots to settle a lawsuit brought by the Department of Justice that sought to block the airlines from merging to create the world's largest carrier, to be called American Airlines.

The following are details of the settlement: Washington Reagan National Airport (DCA): Divest 52 slot pairs, plus gates, including 16 to JetBlue Airways Corp in exchange for slots at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. New York LaGuardia Airport (LGA): Divest 17 slot pairs, plus gates, including five to Southwest Airlines Co and 12 to either Southwest or others.
