 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Sales of Germany's Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) group were almost flat in August as Europe's largest automaker conceded "difficult conditions" in shrinking core markets. 
 Deliveries edged up 0.1 percent last month to 720,400 cars, while eight-month sales were up 4.5 percent to 6.17 million, the Wolfsburg-based manufacturer said on Friday. The 0.1 percent gain is the weakest sales month so far this year for the German giant which also includes luxury division Audi ( NSUG.DE ) and sports-car maker Porsche. Group deliveries in Europe fell 3.3 percent in the first eight months to 2.39 million autos, VW said. (Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by  Christoph Steitz )
