 (Reuters) - Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management cut its stake in mall owner General Growth Properties Inc ( GGP.N ) to 3.7 percent from 8 percent, the hedge fund said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 The fund was the second biggest shareholder in the company after Brookfield Asset Management Inc, which had reported a stake of about 39 percent as of August 8. Ackman has been a passive investor in GGP after he failed to secure a buyer for the company. Pershing Square has been largely flat for the year, following a bruising August in which it lost 3.6 percent. The sharp decline was largely driven by big bets on J.C. Penney Co Inc ( JCP.N ) and Herbalife Ltd ( HLF.N ) and have left Pershing Square, with $10.73 billion in assets, badly trailing the broader hedge fund industry and the overall stock markets. Ackman sold his entire stake in J.C. Penney to Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) last month after his campaign to overhaul the retailer failed. (Reporting By Neha Dimri in Bangalore; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)
