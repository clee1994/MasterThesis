 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Friday that the government will consider offering a stimulus package for the economy without issuing new bonds to finance it. 
 Aso made the comment in a news conference after a cabinet meeting. Japan's public debt exceeded 1 quadrillion yen -- or 1,000 trillion yen ($10.09 trillion), about double the country's GDP, for the first time in June.
