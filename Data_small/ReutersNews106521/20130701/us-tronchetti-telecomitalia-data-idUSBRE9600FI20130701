 MILAN  (Reuters) - An Italian prosecutor has asked for two years imprisonment for businessman Marco Tronchetti Provera in a case involving the alleged use of Telecom Italia ( TLIT.MI ) data to snoop on Italy's elite. 
 In a court hearing on Monday, the prosecutor also asked for a fine of 5,000 euros to be imposed on the businessman. A lawyer representing Tronchetti said the prosecutor's charges were "lacunous and contradictory". Tronchetti, who is head of tire maker Pirelli ( PECI.MI ), headed Telecom Italia from 2001 to 2006.
