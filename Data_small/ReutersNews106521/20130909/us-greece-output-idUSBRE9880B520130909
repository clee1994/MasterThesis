 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greek industrial output fell 8.1 percent year-on-year in July after an upwardly revised 0.6 percent rise in the previous month, the country's statistics service ELSTAT said on Monday. 
 Reduced production of non-metallic minerals, wood and apparel led to a 4.3 percent decline in manufacturing output in July. (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos)
